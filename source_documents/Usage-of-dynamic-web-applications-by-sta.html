<p><p>The following is a "formalisation" of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/08/04/usage-of-wf-applications/">a previous post</a>. This is the version that forms the first draft of a section in the thesis.</p>

<h3>Usage of dynamic web applications by staff and students</h3>

<p>As described in Section 5.3.4, a major addition to the integrated OLE provided by Webfuse from 2000 onwards was in the form of dynamic web applications developed using the Wf framework. This section briefly illustrates and explains the usage of these dynamic web applications by both staff and students from 2000 onwards. It shows how these applications enabled the integrated OLE provided by Webfuse to become a heavily used component of everyday learning and teaching within the institution.</p>
<p>Table 5.16 divides people using the Wf framework applications into students – people enrolled in courses at the institution – and staff – people employed by the institution to deliver and support courses. For each group of users it shows the number of people using the Wf applications each year from 2000 through 2009. It also shows the number of requests those people made of the Wf applications within the given year.</p>

<p>In 2000, the first and only Wf application was called TakeQuiz. As the name suggests, students used TakeQuiz to complete online quizzes. From 2000 through 2002, TakeQuiz was the dominant Wf application used by students accounting for 100% of student requests in 2000 and over 99% in 2001 and 2002. Staff use of TakeQuiz was limited to only two staff testing TakeQuiz to be familiar with the student experience.</p>
<p>The year 2001 saw the development of the initial Wf applications aimed to support staff. These included the results upload application, a facility to generate a class list containing details of enrolled students, an initial online assignment management, quiz management applications, and an access control application for the website. As described in Section 5.3.6 the results upload and class list functionality was implemented in response to difficulties arising from the introduction of a new student records system. The top four Wf applications by staff requests were: results upload (53.4%); online assignment management (15.4%); class list (9%); and, access control (6.9%).</p>
<p>During 2002 the focus on developing Wf applications to better support academic staff continued with the development of Staff MyInfocom, a staff "portal" initially provided staff with simple access to student records. This resulted in a significant increase in staff usage. The top four Wf applications used by staff accounted for almost 83% of staff usage were: Staff MyInfocom (41.3%); Online assignment management (33.5%); Quiz management (4.5%); and, results upload (3.5%).</p>
<p>The usefulness of Staff MyInfocom was such that by 2003, staff from outside Infocom were asking for access. In response a non-Infocom staff "portal" – Staff MyCQU – was developed. The top six Wf applications in 2003 by number of staff requests were: Staff MyInfocom (40%); Staff MyCQU (28.9%); Assignment management (15.9%); results upload (4.3%); informal review of grade (3%); and, quiz management (2.9%). A student "portal" – Student MyInfocom - was also developed in 2003, primarily to help students submit and track their online assignment submissions. The top three Wf applications in 2003 by number of student requests were: Student MyInfocom (55.5%); Take quiz (43%); and, the timetable generator (1.1%).</p>
<p>In 2004, the usage of Staff MyCQU exceeds that of Staff MyInfocom. In 2006, due to an organisational restructure, Staff MyInfocom becomes Staff MyCQU as the services provided become recognised as an institutional service. From 2006 onwards Staff MyCQU is the most used Wf application by staff. Accounting for, on average, 75.5% of staff requests each year. Additional administrative Wf applications are added in 2005 – a system for tracking student academic misconduct incidents – and in 2007 – a system to manage student requests for assignment extensions. By 2009, the number of staff requests on Wf applications breaks the million mark. </p>
<p>In terms of the percentage of staff and students using Wf applications, in 2009, almost 59% of CQU students used a Wf application. This use was primarily online assignment submission. Given there is no way to know how many staff associated with teaching are employed by CQU, it is more difficult to give a figure for percentage of staff. As an indicative figure, the CQU AUQA Performance Portfolio (CQU 2010) summarises the CQU staff profile as consisting of 365 full-time equivalent (FTE) academic staff and 658 non-academic staff for a staff total of 1023. The staff figure for 2009 of 1169 shown in Table 5.16 illustrates how the figure of 1023 does not include a range of staff employed by CQU partners or as casual teaching and support staff. However, there does appear to be a significant percentage of staff using Wf applications.</p>
<p>The large number of requests, significant percentage of staff/students using Wf applications, the use of Wf applications by staff not using the Webfuse course sites, and the breadth of services provided by Wf applications suggests that the Wf applications have been very successful in improving the integrated OLE provided by Webfuse. In particular, the Wf applications have been instrumental in fulfilling the major lessons learned at the end of Chapter 4 – "to better integrated with the requirements and practice of academic staff and students".</p>
