<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>The week since my last <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/17/phd-update-7-a-fortnight-in-review/">PhD update</a> has been a good one. The most productive (in terms of completed first drafts of thesis sections) since I started this series of updates. I feel I'm getting into a routine and slowly developing pragmatic ideas and techniques for producing a thesis that is "good enough".  In reality, I'm probably still to far up the scale towards "too good", but I'm getting there. It's a journey.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p>I almost completed all of what I predicted I would complete.  I said I wanted to have posted to this blog material on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/20/the-paradigms-of-e-learning/">paradigms of e-learning</a>. <strong>DONE!</strong></li>
  <li> Usage of e-learning: <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/23/usage-of-e-learning-quantity/">quantity</a> and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/22/e-learning-usage-quality/">quality</a> (which has had a couple of comments - including a typo fix). <strong>DONE!</strong></li>
  <li> Lessons from past experience<br />This one is just about complete, a couple of paragraphs to go.  I got sidetracked by <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/24/models-of-growth-responding-to-the-grammar-of-school/">this</a>. I aim to post this section tonight, or at the latest tomorrow night. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, I've authored the following blog posts that are somewhat related:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/20/performance-degradation-impact-of-new-lms-implementation/">Performance degradation - impact of new LMS implementation</a>, </li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/22/pedagogy-of-the-impressed-how-teachers-become-victims-of-technology-vision/">Pedagogy of the impressed - how teachers become victims of technology vision</a> , </li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/22/e-learning-usage-quality/">Models of growth - responding to the grammar of school</a><br /> This post talks briefly about a potentially very useful paper from MIT talking about emergent design in education. Something that is at the core of my thesis. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'll do for next</h3>

<p>Essentially, I have finised the "Past Experience" component of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/18/the-ps-framework/">Ps Framework</a>.  Time to pick another component.  So, "Place" it is and probably "Purpose" after that. The aim is that by the end of next week I will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Nutted out a structure for "Place". </li>
  <li> Posted a first draft for "Place". </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also going to try and aim for having similar completed for "Purpose". It's time to speed this process up quite a lot.  Not sure I can do it, but the intent needs to be there. Two components of the Ps Framework is still probably too slow.  We'll see next week.</p></p>
