<p>Tags: phd, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>I've noticed over the last few weeks an increasing number of my colleagues, friends and relatives asking questions like "How long until you finish?"</p>
<p>My response has generally been "how long is a ball of string". After all, writing the thesis is a creative, knowledge intensive activity. Not one conducive to rational acts of planning and timetabling. Anyone who knows me should know how much I hate <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/25/teleological-and-ateleological-processes/">teleological design and prefer ateleological design</a> (for more detail feel free to read other sections of the thesis completed recently on <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/05/teleological-design-definition-and-weaknesses/">teleological processes</a> and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/05/ateleological-processes-definition-and-weaknesses/">ateleological processes</a>) - see some progress is being made.</p>
<p>In addition, you folk really should get a grip on the etiquette associated with thesis writing and PhD study in general.  The following comic from <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/">Piled Higher and Deeper</a> summarises it nicely.</p>

<p>My second most common response to these rude, inconsiderate and ill-informed folk is "It's all on the blog!".  If you really want to know how the PhD is going, please feel free to check out:</p>
<ul>
  <li> my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/phd-to-do-list/">PhD to do list</a>; <br />Newly updated today.  This should give you an idea of how much stuff I think I have to do. Note: there is no connection with this volume and actual time.</li>
  <li> my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/index.php?s=phd+update">sequence of PhD updates</a>; and <br />Up to 14 (weekly) updates and counting.</li>
  <li> the on-going list of posts based on thesis content. <br /><del>Most</del> <del>Many</del> Some of the posts to my blog are filled with content straight from the thesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should provide more than you ever need to know about "how the thesis is going?".</p>
<p><strong>So don't ask!</strong></p></p>
