<p>Tags: elearning, missingPs, Uncategorized</p>

<p>The work on <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52">the missing Ps</a> is intended to contribute some research publications within the information systems field and also form the structure for chapter 2 of my PhD thesis.  Consequently, it is important that the work have a good research foundation.  This post is intended to provide that foundation, or at least document my development of the foundation.

The attempt is to develop a descriptive type of theory, a framework or taxonomy.  Literature that talks about this type of research, appropriate processes and content include
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5422.html">They Cycles of Theory Building in Management Research</a> by Paul Carlile and Clayton Chrstensen </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Reading/Information_Systems/">The nature of theory in information systems</a> by Shirley Gregor </li>
