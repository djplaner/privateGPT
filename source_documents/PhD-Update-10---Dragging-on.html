<p>Tags: Chapter 2, phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Well, I've reached double figures for these updates. The last week has been a slow one, or at least felt like it. The public holiday didn't help, nor the day off to <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/07/pondering-a-new-position/">ponder the new position</a>. Progress has been made, but it just seems slow, especially when compared to what I said I'd do. I'm becoming more used to accepting some progress, be it slow or otherwise, as long as it's moving forward.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/01/phd-update-9-spluttering-out-of-steam/">Last week</a> I suggested I'd try and
<ul>
 <li> Have completed and posted the section on “Place” - only partially done.<br />I have completed and posted three parts of this: <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/06/place-component-of-the-ps-framework/">the introduction</a>, <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/08/society-an-aspect-of-place-impacting-on-e-learning/">society</a>, and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/08/sector-another-part-of-place/">sector</a>.<p>The remaining sections are:
<ul>
  <li> Institution<br />The structure is there as is the content. I've started turning it into prose. </li>
   <li> Types of systems<br />Some content and I know what I want to write - I think.  Still needs structure and turned into prose.</li>
  <li> Lessons from place<br />Most of the content and structure is in place, need to turn it into prose.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li> Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”. - some minor progress.</li>
  <li> Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy. - only very minor changes. </li>
</ul>
<p>The only other PhD associated blog post this week is related to the literature covered in the Place component and the question of whether or not <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/06/university-change-or-die-and-another-problem-with-the-lms-model/">universities are in crisis and might die</a>.  I've connected a perspective on that to the limitations of the LMS model.</p>

<h3>What I'll do for next week</h3>

<p>I'm going to stick with last week's aims:</p>
<ul><li>  Have completed and posted the section on “Place”.</li>
 <li> Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”.</li>
<li> Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations for next week will include the need to spend at least another 2 days thinking about the new position.</p></p>
