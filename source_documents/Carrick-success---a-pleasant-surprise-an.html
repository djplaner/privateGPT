<p>Tags: asciliteMentor, Uncategorized</p>

<p>I received notice today from <a href="http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/bailliep/">Penny de Byl</a> that an application for a <a href="http://www.carrickinstitute.edu.au/carrick/go">Carrick Institute</a> competitive grant had been successful.

Under the title "The seamless integration of Web3D technologies with university curricula to engage the changing student cohort" the project involves teams from both <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/">USQ</a> and <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au">CQU</a> draw on technical expertise of a USQ <a href="http://www.alivex3d.org/tiki-index.php">research group</a> to integrate the use of 3D virtual worlds into learning.

So now that the surprise and joy at being successful has passed the question turns to actually doing the work and hopefully not making too many mistakes.

Next week, as chance would have it, I'll be attending a Carrick function so I hope to start the process of picking the brains of previous recipients about the mistakes to avoid and the good practices to follow.

Any suggestions?

I think it will be especially interesting that this proposal will be inter-organisational. Everything I "know" from the information systems literature is that inter-organisational projects are that much harder to do successfully.</p>
