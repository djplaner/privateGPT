<p><p>This is a simple holding place for some ideas and quotes from George Siemens' recent <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gsiemens/connectivism-changing-times">Connectivism: Changing times</a> talk.</p>

<h3>Fundamental task of education</h3>

Translating this into high school teaching within formal settings raises some interesting questions
<blockquote>...the fundamental task of education is to <em>enculturate youth into this knowledge-creating civilization and to help them find a place in it</em>....traditional educational practices - with its emphasis on knowledge transmission - as well as newer constructivist methods both appear to be limited in scope if not entirely missing the point. (Scardamalia and Bereiter, 2006)</blockquote>

This is the challenge Siemens mentions later
<blockquote>Challenge to repurpose education on explicit system-wide connections and connectedness model</blockquote>

Challenging at the best time of times, but aiming for system-wide, that will be hard.

<h3>Knowledge == learning</h3>

Siemens<blockquote>In networks, knowledge and learning are the same thing: one is the product and the other the process</blockquote>

<h3>How?</h3>

Siemens starts his suggestions with
<blockquote>Complexity, emergence, self-organisation</blockquote>

Which reinforces my beliefs/prejudices and hence is good.  However, it also reinforces how had achieving anything system-wide will be when techno-rational management practices is the standard in formal education, especially public education.

Then comes<blockquote>Social and knowledge connections</blockquote>

I have some ideas about how an individual teacher might enable some of this. Though building on it within a school would be also beneficial. Making the practice common for a cohort would perhaps be the first step.

Then<blockquote>Knowledge-building (growing)</blockquote>

My interpretation is that this is the ultimate goal. You want to model this for the students and then hope that they develop the practice/skill to continue this.  Definitely looks like signing up and working at CCK 2011 should be a priority.

<h3>Segue into analytics</h3>

Towards the end there is the connection to analytics.  Had wondered what got Siemens interested in this.<blockquote>Complete (or nearly) connectedness requires emphasis to shift to data analysis, visualization</blockquote>

This has been one of the questions I've been asking of myself.  One of the best known guidelines for teaching is that you have to start with what the learner knows. If they can't easily make the connection to what you're trying to teach, they won't make the connection, the won't learn. How do you know what a class of 20 to 30 kids know? How do you know what an individual student knows? How can you create environments that enable them to find the connections?

How and what "analytics" can you implement/harness within a school setting? Must admit that analytics as a term turns me off, reminds me of business intelligence folks and feeding management.</p>
