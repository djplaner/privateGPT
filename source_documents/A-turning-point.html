<p>Tags: journey, teaching, Uncategorized</p>

<p>I am unsure whether or not I believe in specific turning points. Perhaps life is a bit more complex. The metaphor of life as a road with specific forks which mark the turning points, seems a bit simplistic. But today does feel like a turning point due to two events:</p>
<ol>
  <li> reaching closure on the PhD; and<br />I've just sent off a <a href="http://davidtjones.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/thesis.pdf">complete draft of the thesis</a> to <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a> for a couple of folk to reading and the provision of pre-submission feedback. The thesis is no longer some Sword of Damocles hanging over my head, demanding attention and effort. Instead, I sit back, <a href="http://legrandepotager.wordpress.com/">have a life</a>, enjoy the family and think about what I might do (hence this post).</li>
  <li> acceptance as a University student.<br />Today I received acceptance into the Graduate Diploma of Learning and Teaching at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQUniversity</a>. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in the blog and my PLN?</h3>

This turning point also marks, I think, a turning point in this blog. It's going to take on a more educational/high school focus. The IT side of things will remain, but there will also be an increase in mathematics since I'll be a math/IT teacher, probably. You are warned.

I'm also wondering how this will and should influence my PLN. I'm already feeling that some of the uni folk I follow are becoming slightly less relevant to my learning needs. Though they do remain interesting and insightful. I'm beginning to wonder if I prune and what I'd miss if I did.

<h3>Ideas and suggestions</h3>

<p>You may want to skip the <a href="#away">whinging diatribe about university L&amp;T</a> and jump <a href="#toward">to the more future looking</a> perspective. This is where I outline what I'm doing to prepare for the future and would love some ideas and suggestions about "what should a novice high school teacher be thinking about?".</p>

<h3>Turning away?</h3>

To some extent I am turning away from being a part of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/09/the-chasm/">the technologists alliance</a> as described by Geoghegan (1994)<blockquote>The last decade has seen the formation of an alliance between "technologist" populations concerned with instructional computing. Those involved include faculty innovators and early adopters, campus IT support organizations, and information technology vendors with products for the instructional market. Ironically, while this alliance has fostered development of many instructional applications that clearly illustrate the benefits that technology can bring to teaching and learning, it has also unknowingly worked to prevent the dissemination of these benefits into the much larger mainstream population.</blockquote> In particularly, I was part of a group within a university charged with helping improve the quality of teaching. Increasingly, most universities have such a group or groups.

I am incredibly happy to be leaving this type of group. Not that there aren't some great people (not to mention some silly and downright dishonest and hurtful) doing some great work. But the technologists alliance within universities, as a whole, is going the wrong way and most of the senior leaders of this alliance are actively enabling that trend. They seem to be actively creating systems that don't value teaching. What's worse, I see a system that is increasingly hurting the members of the alliance that work at the coal face. The type of frustration reported <a href="http://techticker.net/2010/10/26/paint-it-black/">by Mike Bogle</a> is more prevalent than those in leadership positions understand.

The fundamental problem here, at least for me, is the insidious growth of techno-rational approaches to "leadership" within universities. An approach that assumes that the leaders can identify what is required and then tell their staff to implement those solutions. This can never work because Universities and teaching and learning are much more complex than simple solutions. The trouble is that when those solutions fail, it's never because the leadership identified the wrong solutions. It because their staff didn't implement it well enough. The staff carry the can.

To make matters worse, by this time a new VC or other leadership have arrived at the institution. Leadership on a short-term contract determined to make a mark so that they can receive another short-term contract, preferably one step up the ladder. To make their mark, they need to argue for radical change. They need to hold up prior work as somehow flawed, identify some scape goats, identify some new solutions and implement them, preferably minus the scape goats who were suposed to implement the previous solutions.

I suggest that you can see some evidence of this process in the summary of the <a href="http://ow.ly/33xtU">report of an ALTC project</a>. This project was titled "Strategic Leadership for Institutional Teaching and Learning Centres: Developing a Model for the 21st Century".  The report looks at the findings from a survey of 31 of the 38 Directors of Teaching and Learning Centres at Australian universities.  It's first finding was that the average centre "would have been restructured sometime in the previous one to three years".

The triumph of the techno-rational approaches to leadership has resulted in a university sector that is increasingly trying to improve the quality of learning and teaching by fiat. By telling academics you will do X, complete GradCert Y, use LMS Z, be guided by principles L. And at the same time ignoring the context within which academics operate and what those academics already know and are doing.

A few months ago I was interviewed for a position as the head of a group of educational developers. We were asked to provide a vision of the enhancement of learning and teaching. I <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/a-vision-for-enhancement-of-learning-and-teaching-at-cquniversity">provided one</a> that focused on creating an environment that helped academics (and the broader institution) reflect on what was happening and struggling to improve. It wasn't what they wanted to hear.

Based on the questions I was asked, both before and during the interview, the strong message was that they wanted someone who would manage the group as a service provider. I have some qualms about the impact of using the client/server metaphor, but lets leave those aside. The impression I received was not that the client in this relationship was not the teaching academics. The client was the Dean of the faculty. The service to be provided, was whatever the Dean thought was appropriate.  See above points.

Needless to say, I am incredibly happy not to have gotten the job.

<h3>Turning toward?</h3>

Looking forward. In the short term, it looks like I'll be a Math and Information Technology high school teacher. At least that is what I'll be studying next year. I've already started reading and listening to more high school related resources. I'm increasingly interested in being more directly responsible for teaching and being able to experiment with all the insights, tools and practices which I think are important.  At the same time, I'm also realistic enough to know that the school system has its own problems. It too has been invaded by techno-rationalist approaches to management. There are bugger all resources. Aspects of the system are as buggered, if not more so, than the university sector. But importantly, I'm hoping that there will be possibilities for taking some control of what I do in the classroom and subsequently what is inflicted upon students.

In preparation, I've been
<ul>
  <li> listening more to the <a href="http://www.futureofeducation.com/">Future of Education</a> podcasts and looking for more of the same;</li>
  <li> purchased a bunch of books on mathematics in order to (re-)discover my inner math nerd;</li>
  <li> joined the <a href="http://www.aamt.edu.au/">AAMT</a> mailing list;<br />And in a few days have already discovered that I have far to go before being a math nerd.</li>
  <li> begun collecting online resources and sources <a href="http://www.delicious.com/davidj1/teaching">related to teaching</a>; and</li>
  <li> beginning to reflect upon my thoughts on teaching and learning.<br />George Siemens <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2010/11/08/its-new-its-new/">recent post</a> is an interesting spring board, as is much of the above.</li>
</ul>

Either way, it's a damn good feeling to be finally completing one chapter and moving onto another.

If you have ideas or suggestions that can help me be better prepared for this next chapter, fire away.</p>
