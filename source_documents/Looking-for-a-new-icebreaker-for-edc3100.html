<p>Tags: edc3100, teaching</p>

<p>As <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2014/02/03/mav-moodle-process-analytics-and-im-an-idiot/">mentioned previously</a> the simplistic (lazy) introductory forum for #edc3100 didn't achieve it's ill-defined goals. I need to find a new one.

Given I hate ice-breaker activities, I doubt this is going to be very creative. Plus time is against me.

<h2>The context</h2>

#edc3100 is a 3rd year course for pre-service teachers trying to engage them in the task of using ICTs in their teaching. The students are all required to have created their own blog and engage with other social media.

<h2>The goals</h2>

The primary goal is to encourage students to make connections with others. To find out who might be good to follow.

A secondary goal could be to see some different ICTs in action and be required to actually use them for a purpose. This experience can provide grist for reflection.

<h2>The options</h2>

<a href="http://joitskehulsebosch.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/10-online-icebreakers.html">This list of 10 icebreakers</a> includes an idea for students creating a trading card of themselves <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/deck.php">using a tool</a> from Big Huge Labs.  It moves beyond the textual, requires the students to engage with a new service. The purpose of the slide is a question.  Something about them, something about experiences/perspectives of ICTs?

<a href="https://otl.curtin.edu.au/learning_teaching/tl_online/el_activities/icebreakers.cfm">This from Curtin University</a> provides a bit more in the way of design principles from the literature. Interestingly, I'm not certain that the suggested activities are always a good fit for the design principles. e.g. how does creating a video bio (or a trading card as above) "require the learners to read each others entries" which is one of my problems.

<a href="http://twt.wikispaces.com/Ice-Breaker+Ideas">This page</a> has some background on ice-breakers and a few suggestions. One is to require students to find 3 people with whom they have something in commmon and comment on those posts.  This could could work in a Moodle discussion forum with activity completion.

Actually much of the rest of week 1 is focused on students applying <a href="http://speedchange.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page_2046.html">Toolbelt theory/TEST framework</a> to their own study habits. This suggestion might be a bit of duplication, but it may also be a good lead in...mmm.

Another case of possible duplication.  Later in the semester we do a Flickr/image activity based around the weather borrowed from @courosa.

<h2>Pondering</h2>

The activity from last year required students to create the introduction on their blog. The post to the discussion forum only included a link to the student's blog post.  This creates the problem of having to click through to the blog post. You can't see anything interesting in the discussion forum. This was probably a factor in the use of the forum.

This and the above suggests some principles
<ol>
  <li> Have the forum post contain something interesting (i.e. actual information about the student). </li>
  <li> Use the activity completion to require looking and commenting on others. </li>
  <li> Rather than limit to just text, have some form of multimedia involved. </li>
  <li> Have some link to their blog linked to the activity (perhaps reflecting on the task of using the specific ICT) </li>
</ol>

This is leaning back towards the activity we used in 2012 - borrowed from ECMP355 and @courosa again - with the addition of asking the students to find someone they have something in common with and someone they are very different from.

I have added in the suggestion to create a trading card (like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/12600791615/">this one</a>) using <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/deck.php">this web-based tool</a> and also suggested Popplet or Padlet as options and linked to my <a href="http://popplet.com/app/#/196113">2012 poplet</a>.

I'd actually done much of this prior to seeing the suggestion from @catspyajamasnz, now I'm pondering tweaking it a bit.  Have them add in "One thing that annoys me about learning at USQ" -- sounds like a plan.</p>
