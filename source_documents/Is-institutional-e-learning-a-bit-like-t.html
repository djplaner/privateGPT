<p>2013 post updated for 2015 to (un)scientifically test for any changes over time.

<a href="http://dcu.ie/nidl/people/director.shtml">Professor Mark Brown</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mbrownz">@mbrownz</a>) from <del>Massey University</del> the National Institute for Digital Learning at Dublin City University is <a href="http://bit.ly/165UHP5">quoted in a New Zealand newspaper</a> as saying this about institutional e-learning<blockquote>E-learning's a bit like teenage sex. Everyone says they're doing it but not many people really are and those that are doing it are doing it very poorly.</blockquote>

As it happens, this was a point I'm aiming to make/use in a presentation at (the 2013 version of) <a href="http://www.blended-learning.com.au/">this conference</a> (which Prof Brown also happens to be speaking at). A point that will be strengthened by Prof Brown's comments, however, I'm wondering if I can gather some data to explore this further.

<strong>2015 update:</strong> Results of the 2013 surveys (this one and one live during the presentation) are provided in a link at the end of this post. I'll "release" the results of this survey in a week or two.  Perhaps live during my <a href="http://bit.ly/dlrnDEJA">dlrn15 session</a> on <a href="http://sched.co/442o">Sunday 16th October</a>.

<h3>The survey</h3>

To that end please feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vQb7EIi2roE4V1lx_uv8Ue1RNXzq7Edmyu3IMDEKBWw/viewform">complete this brief survey</a>.

It's short, doesn't store any identifying information and I'll share the results here later in the week. The survey doesn't explore all aspects of the relationship between institutional e-learning and teenage sex, it's just a quick exploration of the topic.

Three questions
<ol>
  <li> Your institution's country? </li>
  <li> Multiple choice - "What percentage of your institution's online courses do you consider good?"
        <p>Where good is defined loosely as "good enough to show other folk without being overly embarrassed".</p><p>(This isn't meant to be a well designed survey or formal research).</p> </li>
  <li> Your role was/is within the institution? </li>
</ol>
