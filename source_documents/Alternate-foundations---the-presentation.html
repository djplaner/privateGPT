<p>Tags: complexityLeadership, ples@CQUni, Uncategorized</p>

<p>A <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=202">previous post</a> outlined the abstract for a presentation I gave last Monday on some alternate foundations for leadership of learning and teaching at CQUniversity.  Well, I've finally got the video and slides online so this post reflects on the presentation and gives access to the multimedia resources

<h3>Reflection</h3>

It seemed to go over well but there's significant room for improvement.

The basketball video worked well this time, mainly because the introduction was much better handled.

What was missing
<ul>
  <li> Didn't make the distinction between safe-fail and fail-safe projects. </li>
  <li> Not enough time on implications, strategies and approaches to work with this alternate foundation. </li>
  <li> The description of the different parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin">Cynefin Framework</a> were not good<br />
</ul>

The second point about strategies of working within this area is important as the thinking outlined in the presentation is hopefully going to inform the <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni">PLEs@CQUni</a> project.

<h3>The resources</h3>

The video of the presentation is on Google Video
