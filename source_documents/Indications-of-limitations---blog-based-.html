<p><p>
I'm trying to run an <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/">experiment in blog-based discussions</a>.  Trying to understand, from experience, the realities of using individual blogs for a multi-person discussion.  It's not going well.
</p>
<p>
The first problem was that Wordpress' pingbacks not always working - as briefly mentioned in <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/more-on-blogs-and-discussion/">this post</a>.  The next problem is that links from an external blog (in particular one from Blogger), aren't currently working in a way that is particularly useful for tracking a conversation.
</p>
<p>
Tony has attempted to join in the conversation from his <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> hosted <a href="http://www.vrbones.com/">blog</a> via this &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.vrbones.com/2008/11/conversations-by-trackback.html">post</a>.  He's included a link to my original post in his post. Apparently blogger doesn't support trackbacks.
</p>
<p>
His link has not showed up on the post. However, on the admin interface for my blog there is a section that tracks all links point to my blog posts.  Tony's link has shown up there.  Which isn't all that useful for folk trying to following the conversation.
</p>
<p>
The question will be whether or not there is a configuration setting or a plugin I can enable on my blog to get around this problem.  That's a next task.
