<p>Tags: quotes, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>While chasing down some work by <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=e4WxLQv0mmMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=fullan+nonlinear+change&amp;ots=kBUlGX4Lxt&amp;sig=MNgfIW8wLAT3B8ZiCo-EMuhXYrQ#PPA245,M1">Fullan</a> on educational change I came across the following well-known quote that happens to, based on recent experience, have a fair bit of resonance.</p>
<p><blockquote>We trained hard...but it seemed every time we were beginning to form up into teams we were reorganised. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any situation by reorganising, and what a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralisation. -- Gaius Petronius, A.D. 66</blockquote></p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Petronius_Arbiter">via Wikipedia</a>, I discover that the attribution given by Fullan is <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/25618.html">apparently incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>No matter, the quote still resonates.</p></p>
