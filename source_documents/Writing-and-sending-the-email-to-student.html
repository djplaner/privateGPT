<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p>I'm trying to come up with the email that I'll send to all the DE students telling them about the how and why they'll be creating a blog for COIT11134.

<strong>Important Lesson(s)</strong>

Wordpress, the blog hosting option I've chosen, seems simple and easy to use.  Should be a good choice. But my perception is almost certainly going to be different to the students.

<strong>Problems?</strong>

How the hell do I make the email small enough for students to read it but still provide all the information that is required?  How can I possibly explain blogs when I don't really know the backgrounds of the students?  How do I stop myself from telling them too much or not telling them enough?

Perhaps I just have to do it and then hope they'll ask questions and let me know.
