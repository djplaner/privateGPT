<p>Tags: iLecture, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>As part of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/09/28/small-changes-in-lectures-ustream-votapedia/">experiment in presentations</a> I'm planning for later in this month involves the use of alternate types of clickers or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response">audience response systems</a>.  The aim of this part of the experiment is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Identify a technology that breaks the limitations of the current clickers provided by publishers.<br />This includes the need for students to purchase them and being based on a technology that means you have to be in the room to participate. </li>
  <li> Identify sound strategies for using them.</li></ol>
<p>This post is about the journey through the literature around clickers and what I've found.</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>I'm planning to/using the following resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li> EDUCAUSE resources on clickers/audience response systems.<br />I've come across these in recent years and started <a href="http://www.educause.edu/Resources/Browse/ClassroomResponseSystems/28524">here</a> because of familiarity.</li>
  <li> Scholar Google.<br />Next strategy was to ,a href="http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=clickers&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;search scholar google</a> for papers on clickers and related topics. </li>
  <li> Local experience and expertise. <br />There's been at least one staff member at my host institution that has used clickers. I'm hoping to chat with them about their experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misc. immediate thoughts</h3>

<h4>Prevalence in the sciences</h4>

<p>Clickers seem to be most prevalent within the sciences.  The top searches in scholar google for "clickers" included the following journals: Developmental Cell, Life Sciences Education, Journal of College Science Teaching, Astronomy Education Review, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.</p>
<p>I seem to remember a talk by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/longpd/www/longpd.htm">Phil Long</a> linking clickers to the work in the sciences of establishing rigorous pre/post tests for important concepts.  Wonder how that will impact use in other areas?  Both in terms of the absence of the pre/post tests but also the apparent observation that most usage of clickers is in the sciences?  Does <a>TPACK</a> play a role?</p>

<h4>There's a long history</h4>

<p>First introduced in the mid-1960s (Kay and LeSage, 2009)</p>

<h3>Lit review</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet25/kay.html">Kay and LeSage (2009)</a> provide a recent lit review of "clickers".</p>
<p>Typically used in large undergraduate classrooms in maths and science.  Students like them, but clickers alone don't improve learning, need appropriate strategies.</p>
<p>Student concerns include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> extra effort to discuss answers </li>
  <li> wanting response to be anonymous </li>
  <li> discomfort when responding incorrectly </li>
  <li> distracted by use of ARS (audience response systems)</li>
  <li> general resistance to new methods of learning </li>
</ul>
<p>Generic strategy stuff:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain why ARS being used. </li>
  <li> Have practice questions. </li>
  <li> Question design.<br />Question setting takes time, every question should have a pedagogical purpose. Various advice on what types of question to use them for.  2 to 5 questions per 50 minutes.  Multi-choice.  Questions take 5-10 minutes to display, discuss and resolve.  Raises the fear of content coverage.</li>
  <li> ARS used for attendance, participation and engagement. </li>
  <li> Assessment strategies: formative, contingent teaching and summative. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Another one</h3>

<p>Judson (2002) suggests four important findings from a lit review:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Students will favor the use of electronic response systems no matter the nature of the underlying pedagogy.</li>
  <li> Academic achievement does not correlate to behaviorist use of electronic response systems, as highlighted by investigations of the 1960s and 1970s.</li>
  <li> Despite “high-tech” improvements, the use of electronic response systems within a behaviorist pedagogy has not produced gains in achievement.</li>
  <li> Interactive engagement has been shown to correlate to student conceptual gains in physics. Interactive engagement can be well facilitated in large lecture halls through the use of electronic response systems.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Another tack</h3>

<p>Beatty and Gerace (2009) take another tack <blockquote>In other words, don’t ask what the learning gain
from CRS use is; ask what pedagogical approaches a CRS
can aid or enable or magnify, and what the learning
impacts of those various approaches are.</blockquote></p>
<p>They identify 3 separate efforts to develop a coherent pedagogy for clickers</p>
<ol>
  <li> Mazur's <em>Peer Instruction</em><br />Regularly insert multiple-choice conceptual questions about the material, if students answer incorrectly, get them to discuss it and answer again. Some empirical support for improvement.</li>
  <li> <em>Assessing-to-learn</em> or <em>Question-Driven Instruction</em> somewhat similar.<br />Has a specific iterative pattern of question asking and answering that forms the basis for the learning activity, only mini-lectures given on the side. </li>
  <li>  Another based on related questions and specific patterns.</li>
</ol>
<p>They propose <em>Technology-enhanced formative assessment</em> (TEFA) which evolved from and supersedes, A2L</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Need some more thought about just how this literature might inform my use of clickers in the presentation.  Constraints on the presentation may limit this.</p>
