<p><p>The following is an early attempt at an "executive summary" for the alignment project. It's meant to get folk who know nothing about the project excited, or at least interested, in the project.  The main audience, at the moment, is probably limited to institutional leaders around learning and teaching and those likely to be evaluating ALTC grant applications.</p>
<p>Suggestions and criticisms more than welcome.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in literature references that support some of the observations/claims e.g. that consideration of alignment is not part of everyday teaching practice for teaching academics.</p>

<h3>Executive summary</h3>

<p>Instructional (Cohen, 1987), curriculum (Anderson, 2002) and constructive (Biggs, 1996) alignment are all built on the recognition that student learning outcomes are significantly higher when there is a strong link between those learning outcomes, the assessment and the instructional activities and materials. Cohen (1987) argues that limitations in learning is not mainly caused by ineffective teaching, but instead is mostly the result of a misalignment between what teachers teach, what they intended to teach, and what they assessed as having been taught. The importance of achieving and demonstrating alignment with expected outcomes is also a central component of outcomes-based accreditation and quality assurance approaches that are increasingly widespread within higher education. </p>
<p>For most teaching academics, however, the consideration of alignment in their courses and programs   is not part of everyday teaching practice. Consideration of alignment is typically limited to events such as significant re-design of courses and programs of visits from accreditation or quality assurance organizations. This lack of regular consideration of alignment may be a significant contributing factor to the on-going limitations of university learning and teaching and its quality assurance processes. For example, Barrie et al (Barrie, Hughes, &amp; Smith, 2009) make the observation<blockquote>despite the rhetoric of graduate attributes policy and despite the espoused claims of statements of course learning outcomes, the reality is that teaching in some courses has not changed from a model of transmission of factual content.</blockquote></p>
<p>Through a collaborative action research process this project seeks to build and grow distributive leadership capacity within the systems and processes of the two participating institutions that encourages and enables consideration of alignment, and action-based on that consideration, to become a regular, transparent, supported and integrated part of common teaching practice. Through this the project seeks to explore steps towards adoption Biggs' model of the reflective institution. As a result the project aims to develop approaches that can systemically enhance learning and teaching through enabling and encouraging teaching academics to question and change their conceptions and practice of learning and teaching and through this on-going consideration of alignment significantly improve student learning outcomes. </p>
