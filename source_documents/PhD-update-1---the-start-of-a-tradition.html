<p>In attempt to encourage on-going work and solve the problem of keeping various folk updated I'm going to start a new Friday tradition - posting a summary of the PhD related work I did in the last week.  Here's to the first of many.</p>

<h3>20th to 27th February</h3>

<p>In the last week I've</p>
<ul>
  <li> Given a presentation on the thesis at <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">the ANU</a> </li>
  <li> Caught up on some literature on higher education. </li>
  <li> Had a related paper accepted at an international conference. </li>
  <li> Created a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/phd-to-do-list/">to do list/overview</a> of the thesis. </li>
  <li> Given some thought to the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/10/09/the-anatomy-of-a-design-science-paper-a-research-note/">research note</a> describing how to write up information systems design research work. </li>
</ul>

<p>I close with what I currently think I'll aim for next week.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>129 slides in 30 minutes, given, recorded and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning">placed onto slideshare</a> and turned into a slidecast.  In the last week, the slidecast has just gone past the 100 views.</p>

<h3>Literature on higher education</h3>

<p>For some reason, earlier in the week I ended up looking at the online archives of the journal <a href="http://www.springer.com/education/higher+education/journal/10734">Higher Education</a>.  Found a number of papers of interest, both to the PhD and other work. </p>
<p>I've incorporate the work of a number of these papers into Chapter 2.  I've found this much easier now that I have a firm grasp on the Ps Framework.  Having that structure makes it much easier (but not straight forward) to build the argument.</p>
<p>What I've been reading has also led to a couple of blog posts.  Some of these have been trying to get arguments for the thesis down in to prose.</p>

<h3>To do list</h3>

<p>Today I've achieve the major thing I wanted to do this week.  Get some overall idea of where the thesis is up to, what its structure is and what is left to do.  The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/phd-to-do-list/">to do list</a> serves this purpose.  I hope to keep this updated, both adding and striking out, to dos as time progresses.</p>

<h3>Presenting design research work</h3>

<p>Originally, the submission to JAIS of <a href="http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol8/iss5/1/">Gregor and Jones (2007)</a> included an appendix that offered a suggested structure for a design theory/research thesis/paper. They didn't want to publish the appendix so we put it <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/10/09/the-anatomy-of-a-design-science-paper-a-research-note/">online</a> a couple of months ago.  </p>
<p>At least one of us is keen to get this published. Today I blogged <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/27/why-formulaic-guidance-annoys-experts-and-why-they-ignore-the-needs-of-the-novice/">another post</a> providing a potential argument about why the research note is important, even though "experts" will think it problematic.</p>

<h3>Next week</h3>

<p>For the foreseeable future (a few weeks at least) I think my major aim will be two fold:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Make significant progress, if not complete a draft of Chapter 2 on the Ps Framework. </li>
  <li> Similar progress on Chapter 3 - especially because I want to get feedback on the ideas I currently have, which may prove to be novel and consequently somewhat limited. </li>
</ol></p>
