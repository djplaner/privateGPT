<p>Tags: Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.jackbe.com/blogs/?p=27">blog post</a> from the company <a href="http://www.jackbe.com/">JackBE</a>, apparently by a guy called <a href="http://www.jackbe.com/blogs/index.php/category/jackbloggers/mike-wagner/">Mike Wagner</a> tries to make the argument about why the term Rich Internet Applications (RIA - applications built with new style web interface technologies, e.g. Ajax etc) needs to be extended/enhanced to Rich Enterprise Applications (REAs).

If I were really cynical I could argue that this is a ploy by a commercial company to push their wares.  JackBE coined the REA term.

Putting that bit of cynicism aside, my real interest in the post is the apparently unsupported contention that enterprises need something extra that the rest of the user population don't.  They need "governance".

The post argues that ad hoc RIAs/mashups are fine for someone playing around but an enterprise needs "governance and security and commercial-grade reliability".  The post posits this is the difference between Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 and applies to RIAs and REAs.

Do enterprises really need anything different?

I'm not so sure.  Services like Google have create an expectation amongst consumers.  In the years that I've been using Google it has always been available, I can remember only two or three glitches that forced me to do a refresh and its services have been incredibly easy and effective.  I expect all the sites I use to meet this same expectation and I believe many others also do.

So when I use or design a mashup, a RIA or a bit of Web 2.0 I want to ensure I meet that expectation.

Would any enterprise system be unhappy if it met the Google expectation level?  Almost all of the enterprise systems I've experienced are nowhere near achieving this level.  Enterprise systems within <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a> are generally 9-to-5 systems.  If that.  The various online banking systems I use are kludgy and have been unavailable a number of times.

To me this covers, security and reliability.  So all that is left is "governance".   What is actually meant by governance.  The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance">defintion</a>

<blockquote>
Corporate governance aims to:
<ul>
     <li> align the actions of the individual parts of an organisation toward aggregate mutual benefit
    </li>
      <li>provide the means by which each individual part of the organisation can trust that the other parts each make their contribution to the mutual benefit of the organisation and that none gain unfairly at the expense of others
    </li>
      <li> provide a means by which information can quickly flow between the various stakeholders to ensure that the changing nature of both the stakeholder needs and desires and the environment in which the organisation operates get effectively factored into decision processes
    </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The articles proposal that "REAs = RIAs + governance" seems to be harking back to the bad old days of command and control.  We can only achieve these aims if we control how they do it.

It seems to me that this breaks many of the ideas of Web 2.0.

So, I don't think that there's much point in the new acronym.  I'm also wondering if there is an argument to be made against the use of "Enterprise 2.0"?   To be considered.</p>
