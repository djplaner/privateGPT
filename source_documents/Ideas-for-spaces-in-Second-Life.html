<p>CQU has recently invested in an <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=157">island</a> in Second Life for the purposes of <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Web3D_Exchange_Project">finding out how it might be used within learning and teaching</a>. One of the problems we have to face is how and what spaces do we build on the island.

In this post I wonder if there are some lessons to be learned from the work that is being done to develop <a href="http://www.educause.edu/LearningSpaces">next generation learning spaces</a> in the real world.  In particular, I'm going to rely on a slide or two from a presentation given by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/longpd/www/longpd.htm">Dr Phillip Long</a> at a symposium at <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a> last year.

The slides and (some of) the audio from the presentation can be found <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/nextgenerationlearningspace/presentations">here</a>. If there were time I'd be taking a more detailed look at this <a href="http://www.educause.edu/LearningSpaces">book on the topic</a> from Educause.

<h3>Supporting families of pedagogies</h3>

Around about slide 150 of the presentation the suggestion is made that next generation learning spaces should be designed to support families of pedagogies. Then a list of 10 spaces are described.  The list is
<ol>
  <li> Thinking/conceiving spaces (spaces for deliberating, brainstorming)<br />
  </li>
  <li> Designing spaces (spaces for putting structure, order, and context to free-ranging ideas)
  </li>
  <li> Presenting spaces (spaces for showing things to a group)
  </li>
  <li> Collaborating spaces (spaces for enabling team activities)
  </li>
  <li> Debating or negotiating spaces (spaces for facilitating negotiations)
  </li>
  <li> Documenting spaces (spaces for describing and informing specific activities, objects, or other actions)
  </li>
  <li> Implementing/associating spaces (spaces for bringing together related things needed to accomplish as task or a goal)
  </li>
  <li> Practicing spaces (spaces for investigating specific disciplines)
  </li>
  <li> Sensing spaces (spaces for pervasively monitoring a location)
  </li>
  <li> Operating spaces (spaces for controlling systems, tools, and complex environments)
  </li>
</ol>

The list, at first blush, seems to offer a useful framework for thinking about types of spaces that might be usefully developed within a virtual environment. In particular, it identifies that there are many other types of spaces beyond the "presenting spaces" that many will tend towards.

A problem is that the audio of the presentation appears to give out long before these slides are covered which leads to the need for a bit of interpretation about exactly what some of these spaces may be like.

We have some <a href="http://gss.cqu.edu.au/">folk here at CQU</a> into the use of technology to enable group-based work including brainstorming etc.  A couple of the spaces above could be well informed by that sort of work.

If this is going to prove useful at all, I believe we may need to find some examples in Second Life of spaces which fit into the different categories above.</p>
