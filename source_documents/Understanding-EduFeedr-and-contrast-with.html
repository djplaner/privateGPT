<p>Tags: bim, Uncategorized</p>

<p>The following is an attempt to summarise an attempt to understanding <a href="http://www.edufeedr.net/">EduFeedr</a> a bit more. Especially to compare and contrast it with <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a>. I'm particularly interested in seeing what lessons can be learned from EduFeedr, not to mention what code and ideas can be borrowed.

<h3>What</h3>

<blockquote>EduFeedr is an educationally enhanced feed reader, designed specifically for courses that take place in a distributed learning environment where all students use their personal blogs and other social software.</blockquote> i.e. EduFeedr is aimed at open courses. The need for it arose out of experiences with such courses and the workload involved in tracking contributions.

EduFeedr offers four main tasks
<ol>
  <li> setting up the course;<br />Each course has a <a href="http://www.edufeedr.net/pg/edufeedr/view_educourse/34">"site"</a>.   Each site has six sections: (1) course feed, (2) course info, (3) participants, (4) assignments, (5) progress, and (6) social network.
   <p><em>BIM:</em> is a Moodle activity. Each Moodle course can have multiple BIM activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li> enrolling to the course,<br />Done via a simple form with name, email and blog url<p><em>BIM:</em> students have to be enrolled in the Moodle course containing the BIM activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li> aggregating blog posts and comments, and <br />
  <p><em>BIM:</em> only aggregates posts</p>
  </li>
  <li> visualizing the progress and social network between the learners.<br /><a href="http://www.edufeedr.net/pg/edufeedr/view_educourse/41?filter=connections">Displayed</a> on EduFeedr and also able to be downloaded.  Information can be downloaded in various formats, including: OPML file containing all post and comment feeds; a vCard for email addresses of participants; HTML blogroll.
  <p><em>BIM:</em> student details are available via various Moodle sources. BIM does provide an OPML file for teaching staff containing the URLs for their students' feeds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

EduFeedr is implemented on top of <a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a> and uses <a href="http://simplepie.org/">Simplepie</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsviz/">JSViz</a>.

Actually, the retrieval of the feeds is done by a companion utility called EduSuckr. EduSuckr is run hourly.  <em>BIM:</em> mirroring also run via cron, but time is controlled via the Moodle configuration interface.  Mirroring of an individual student blog is also done when a student attempts to view their details.

EduFeedr and EduSuckr appear to communicate via WSDL/SOAP.

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<ul>
  <li> No standard way to locate comments feed.<br /><em>BIM:</em> doesn't look at comments, but I assumed this might be a problem. </li>
  <li> Linking posts to assignments.<br />Appear that they expect students to link to the description of the assignment for the post.<p><em>BIM:</em> tries to compare the title  and content of the student blog post with the title/content of the assignment question using simple similarity comparison.  Teaching staff can also allocate a student post to a particular assignment question....future plan is to allow the students to do this as well. </li>
  <li> Linking comments with participants.<br />Again lack of standards with identifying authors of comments, makes this difficult.<p><em>BIM:</em> doesn't look at comments, so not a problem.</li>
  <li> Only recent items in feeds.<br />This is a problem with BIM as well. EduSuckr uses the same solution as BIM. It keeps a local archive of all posts. The teacher can specify a period when to archive posts.  BIM has the option for mirroring to be turned off.</li>
</ul></p>
