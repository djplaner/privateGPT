<p>Tags: elearning, innovation, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Theoretically, I'm in the process of starting <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/">a new job</a> that is focused on encouraging e-learning and innovation within a university context. The following post is an early attempt to try and make sense of this job, what it might do and how it might do it. It's probably of little value to others, but I'm trying to be open about this.</p>
<p>This is still early days and the understanding will continue to grow and change. Due to the nature of human beings as <a href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/08/imperium_cogito.php">pattern matching intelligences</a> this exploration will necessarily, as arising out of my own attempts to make sense of this job, illustrate my past experiences and patterns of action.  Feel free to disagree and suggest alternative perspectives.</p>

<h3>The model</h3>

<p>The following started out as a 2x2 framework but has evolved as I've been writing this post. The attempt of the model is to represent the process and two of the decisions that have to be answered went attempting a change or innovation within an organisation. In summary, the idea is that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Some <strong>spark</strong> creates the need for the change or innovation. </li>
  <li> This makes it necessary to decide <strong>what to do</strong> in order to respond to the spark. </li>
  <li> Once what is decided it is necessary to decide <strong>how to do it</strong>. </li>
  <li> How things are done can also contribute to the next or different sparks. </li>
</ul>
<p>I've purposely not included numbers in the above list. Cycles can start in any of these stages and there isn't always a cycle. In fact, some might argue a significant flaw in many organisations is a failure to draw knowledge from how things were done in order to inform the next spark. Alternatively, it may not always be possible to connect the causal cycle until after the fact.</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3526475317/" title="A Change Cycle by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="A Change Cycle" height="174" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3566/3526475317_cb9dca2ebb_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<h4>The spark</h4>

<p>There is generally a spark, some event, thing, or knowledge that makes it necessary to make some change or undertake some action.  It might be to solve a problem or achieve a goal. The spark may not be identified prior to the change, only after. The model suggests that such a spark can arise from a spectrum with two extreme dimensions:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Idealistic; and<br />In this context, something at the idealistic end would generally be something created by an expert, management or government. For example last night the Australian Federal Government released it's budget for the next year and it includes <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25470917-12332,00.html">a number of projects and changes</a> that will require strategic responses from Australian Universities. Alternatively, it might be something internal to an organisation such as the <a href="http://uninews.cqu.edu.au/UniNews/viewStory.do?story=5831">appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor</a>.</li>
  <li> Naturalistic.<br />In this context, this is understood to be something that arises from the "coal-face" of the organisation. An extreme example might be an individual academic faced with a group students not understanding a particular concept. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is meant to be a spectrum, an example from the middle might be an institution (not a single academic) identifying long turnaround times on assignment feedback.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>Given a spark, it is necessary to identify what to do. What can be done to respond to the spark? Of all the different projects that might work, how does an institution or individual identify what to do?</p>
<p>The model represents two extreme ends of a spectrum:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Fad; and <br />This is where a project is chosen simply because someone else has done it.  e.g. "boys with toys" represents a lone-ranger academic adopting the use of Twitter because he saw the Oprah show on Twitter.</li>
  <li> Knowledge.<br />The chosen project is identified based on some  theoretical knowledge - be it organisational, learning, technical etc - and its application to the local context. For example, the adoption of constructive alignment based on the ideas of Biggs.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>Having decided what to do, it is now necessary to plan how to do it. This spectrum draws on a distinction made by Kurtz and Snowden (2007) and is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/09/how-to-improve-lt-and-e-learning-at-universities/">one I've used before</a>. The following table compares the two approaches.</p>
<table border="5" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th>Idealistic</th>
<th>Naturalistic</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Achieve ideal state</td>
<td valign="top">Understand a sufficiency of the present in order to stimulate evolution</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Privilege expert knowledge, analysis and interpretation</td>
<td valign="top">Favour enabling emergent meaning at the ground level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Separate diagnosis from intervention</td>
<td valign="top">Diagnosis and intervention to be intertwined with practice</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Snowden's point - and I agree - is that idealistic approaches only work in contexts in which there is a clear connection between cause and effect. i.e. you can predict that if you do X, then Y will happen. Snowden points out in his Cynefin framework and associated writing that there are other contexts, that require different approaches.</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3524377954/" title="Cynefin domains by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Cynefin domains" height="182" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3654/3524377954_4f5c93c710_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<h3>Putting the model in context</h3>

<p>The rest of the post attempts to use the above model to begin understanding the context within which the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/">new job</a> takes place. The aim is to help me formulate plans for the position that I need to raise with the hierarchy to get approval. It covers</p>
<ul>
  <li> the spark; and<br />An attempt to identify factors, both naturalistic and idealistic, that are creating a need for change or innovation within the institution. </li>
  <li> a list of projects.<br />Based on  combination of "what to do" and "how to do it" and knowledge/prejudices around the local context identify an initial list of potential projects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the thinking that follows does (or will/should) include a range of existing projects and processes within the organisation. While the new position may not be directly connected with these projects and processes it is necessary for the position to be aware of an work with those projects and processes. </p>
<p>This is only an initial list - it will grow and change as time goes by.</p>

<h3>The spark</h3>

<p>The following aims to provide an initial list of potential sparks that might be important for the new position to either do something about or at least work with or inform. I've attempted to group them in some initial rough categories as a way to help brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
  <li> From the position description. </li>
  <li> Organisational strategic plans. </li>
  <li> Organisational factors. </li>
  <li> Government policies and other external factors. </li>
</ul>

<h4>From the position description</h4>

<p>The new position comes with a list of accountabilities by which the incumbent will be judged. Not surprisingly, this focuses the attention. The following are drawn from those accountabilities.</p>
<ul>
          <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/#SoTL">Teaching/Research nexus</a>. </li>
          <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/#SoTL">Scholarship of teaching and learning</a>. </li>
          <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/#Trends">Industry development and trends</a>. <br /><a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/30/analysis-of-emerging-trends-affecting-the-use-of-technology-in-education/">George Siemens</a> points to some sources for emerging trends including <a href="http://emergingtechnologies.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=etr&amp;rid=14522">BECTA analysis of emerging trends</a>, the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/horizon">Horizon project</a> and <a href="http://www.icvet.tafensw.edu.au/resources/futures_thinking.htm">ideas about future thinking</a>.  There's also <a href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/innovationjubilation/">TrendWatching.com</a>. <p>Of course, I have some questions about how people and their pattern matching intelligences can be good at futures thinking. I tend to prefer the aproach embodied in Alan Kay's quote<blockquote>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</blockquote></li>
          <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/#CommunicateAndPublish">Literature</a>. </li>
      </ul>

<h4>Organisational strategic plans</h4>

<p>Like most institutions mine has developed a <a href="http://content.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/view.do?page=8281">strategic plan</a>, but it also has a range of other organisational goals, understandings and cultures that also have to be considered. I need to better understand these.</p>
<p> First, focus on the strategic plan which is divided up into 8 main sections. Many of the components of these aims are the responsibility of existing organisational units. I'll focus on the ones that appear to connect with the new job, but leave the others in <del>but struck through</del>. Each component is further divided into: what we need to do; how we will do it; how will we know that we are doing it well.</p>

<p>Need to find out which parts of the organisation are responsible for the above and what they are doing.</p>

<h4>Organisational factors</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most open to debate, given lack of agreement amongst stakeholders and some of the points about Model 1 behaviour, but just as important. Some of the following connect with strategic plans.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Evaluation of learning and teaching - beyond just course based and other limitations. </li>
  <li> Flexibility and quality of learning platforms and technologies. </li>
  <li> Actual quality of learning and teaching, administration, e-learning. </li>
  <li> An emphasis on fad and idealistic dimensions. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Government strategies</h4>

<ul>
      <li> Teaching funding linked to performance outcomes on quality, particiaption and completion rates. </li>
      <li> Student centred funding. </li>
</ul>

<h3>List of projects</h4>

<p>An early version of the model in this post was a traditional 2x2 model (with slightly different labels).  While I've moved on from there and think the two dimensions are spectrums the 2x2 model offers some help in understanding what could be done. The following table summarises.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <th> Sector </th>
    <th> Description</th>
    <th> What can be done</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Idealistic-fads</td>
    <td valign="top">The pre-dominant mode within organisations.</td>
    <td valign="top">This position will probably have little influence on these projects as they are driven by senior management. The best that can be hoped is to provide evidence and insight to those making decisions. Focused on nature of the organisation and the experience of students and staff. Helping increase the quality and quantity of the feedback to these folk. Make them aware of the limitations of the chosen approaches. Make sure that the knowledge generated from these projects is available and used to inform subsequent projects. Be aware of the fads/trends that are rising and become familiar with them. Perhaps attempt.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Idealistic-knowledge</td>
    <td valign="top">Generally limited use at the organisational level, some use in isolated areas</td>
    <td valign="top">The insights from the projects are likely to be useful. Ensure that the knowledge is disseminated and informs subsequent projects. Be aware of the types of knowledge that can help inform proejcts and their implementation.<p>This is probably where traditional university "innovation" grants sit. Probably have to engage with these but the cartoon below stikes me as saying a few things about these grants and there's also the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/18/blame-the-teacher-and-its-negative-impact-on-learning-and-e-learning/">work of Findlow.</a></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Naturalistic-fads</td>
    <td valign="top">A common approach - often seen in lone rangers</td>
    <td valign="top">No point, ability or benefit in stopping these.  Better to help inform their implementation and learn their lessons. How to do this effectively is another question. There are some connections here or perhaps in the next sector with <a href="http://tlt-swg.blogspot.com/2008/02/fostering-incremental-cumulative.html">incremental, cumulative improvement</a> arising out of the work of the <a href="http://www.tltgroup.org/">Teaching, Learning, Technology group</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Naturalistic-knowledge</td>
    <td valign="top">Rarely used and the sector I feel most appropriate for innovation around learning and teaching.</td>
    <td valign="top">Have talked previously about the idea of reflective alignment. Something I'd like to try.  Perhaps there are others.</td>
  </tr>
