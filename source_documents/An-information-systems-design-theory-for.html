<p><p>Yesterday I gave a presentation at <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">the Australian National University</a> on my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">PhD</a>.  I'm doing it through ANU and this 30 minute presentation is a standard requirement of study.  The slides are up on <a href="http://slideshare.net/">slideshare</a> (embedded below). I recorded the audio and will be trying to put that online later on today and make the slides into a slidecast.</p>

<h3>The presentation</h3>

<p>It appears embedding the presentation in this post isn't working at the moment.  The slides can be <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning">found here</a> on slideshare. -- seems the embedding is working now.</p>

<h3>The description</h3>

<p>It's been a while since I worked directly on the PhD and creating this presentation was a way to become deeply familiar with the thesis again, in preparation for writing it up.  So the presentation is structured in line with the thesis and provides a high level overview of the whole thing.</p>
<p>While the information systems design theory (ISDT) that is the main product of the thesis gets a mention, explaining the design theory is not the primary goal of the presentation. Such descriptions have been given in other papers (<a href="https://djon.es/blog/?attachment_id=520">Jones and Gregor, 2002</a>; <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/the-formulation-of-an-isdt-for-e-learning/">Jones and Gregor, 2004</a>). Instead the emphasis of the presentation is on the other components of the thesis that are in need of some extra work.</p>
<p>Most of the content of the presentation is focused on chapter 2 and the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/16/frameworks-and-representation-tidy-versus-messy/">Ps Framework</a>. In fact, must of it is related around the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/15/alternatives-for-the-institutional-implementation-of-e-learning-lessons-from-13-years-of-webfuse/">content of a paper</a> I've proposed for later in the year. </p>
<p>Essentially the idea is that the practice of e-learning within universities has a definite orthodoxy (which LMS will we adopt). I suggest that for a number of reasons the understandings that underpin that orthodoxy are entirely inappropriate and this is why most university e-learning implementations are plagued by less than widespread use by academics, low quality learning by those that do use it and some concerns around return on investment.</p>
<p>There's also some early work on the structure of chapter 3 - the research method.  But still early days there.</p>
