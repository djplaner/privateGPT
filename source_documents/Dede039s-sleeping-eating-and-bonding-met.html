<p><p>Earlier this year I posted on <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/14/disruption-and-the-mythic-technologies-of-education/">Disruption and the “mythic” technologies of education</a> and my views about consistency and diversity when applied to learning, especially e-learning within universities. </p>
<p>That post was sparked by a <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=734">presentation</a> by <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/">Gardner Campbell</a>.  Of the many things I found striking was the video of <a href="http://gseweb.harvard.edu/~dedech/">Chris Dede</a> using "eating, sleeping and bonding" as a framework to understand the diversity inherent in learning.</p>
<p>As it happens, I'm currently working on the "pedagogy" component of my thesis. In particular, I'm working on the section I'm calling "Learning theories, research and advice for pedagogues".  A key point I'm looking to make is that diversity is inherent in learning. Hence the connection to Dede's metaphor/framework.</p>
<p>The main driver for this post is that I've found a publication (<a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=X2dIYc5PpTkC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=jwx6C0kB_l&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Dede, 2008</a>) in which Dede writes about the metaphor/framework and expands beyond the bit I heard in the video. I know it has its issues, but you have to love <a href="http://books.google.com">Google Books</a>, without it I would not have found this book chapter.  Nor could I link you <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=X2dIYc5PpTkC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=jwx6C0kB_l&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">to the page</a> on which the metaphor/framework is discussed (it starts under the heading "Reconceptualizing media as empowering diversity in learning").</p>
<p>The following are some other quotes from the book chapter that I found useful for my purposes<blockquote>from an instrumental perspective, the history of tool making shows that the best strategy is to have simultaneously available a variety of specialized tools, rather than a single device that attempts to accomplish everything...<br /><br />
No educational ICT is universally good; and the best way to invest in instructional technologies is an instrumental approach that analyzes the natures of the curriculum, students, and teachers to select the appropriate tools, applications, media and environments..<br /><br />
To progress, the field of instructional design must recognize that learning is a human activity quite diverse in its manifestations from person to person, and even from day to day. The emphasis can then shift to developing pedagogical media that provide many alternative ways of teaching, which learners select as they engage in their educational experiences</blockquote></p>
