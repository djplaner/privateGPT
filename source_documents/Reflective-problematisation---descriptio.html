<p><p>Thinking about <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/26/improving-university-teaching-learning-from-constructive-alignment-by-not-mandating-it/">reflective alignment</a>, I came across the following quote in Booth and Anderberg (2005).  Thought it might be useful so am saving it here.</p>
<p><blockquote>the equally important notion of reflective problematization - deliberately distancing oneself from the familiar, deliberately avoiding the taken-for-granted and considering the alternatives that might be at hand, relating to theories and experience and reaching an analytical insight into productive change.</blockquote></p>
<p>The connection with "reflective alignment" is that this is a pretty good description of the type of reflection which I observe in the "good" teachers.  It's the type of reflection "reflective alignment" would seek to encourage and enable.</p>
