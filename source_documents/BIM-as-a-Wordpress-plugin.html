<p>Tags: bim, bim2, Uncategorized</p>

<p>I'm currently programming up bim2, a new version <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">of BIM</a> to work with Moodle 2.0. I'm wondering whether a version of BIM for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> might be an idea.

A while ago Leigh Blackall wondered why <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/04/25/inside-out-outside-in-or-both/">BIM had to be inside an LMS</a>. There were some reasons at the time. However, most no longer apply and I'm increasingly interested in moving beyond the LMS world.  As a long-term Wordpress user, a Wordpress plugin might make some sense.

Such a plugin would be a small step away from BIM towards <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/11/16/edufeedr-is-live-bim-for-open-blog-courses/">edufeedr</a>.  Both BIM and edufeedr are very similar in what they do. The main difference is the infrastructure they rely upon, BIM on Moodle and edufeedr on elgg (if I recollect correctly). Wordpress is perhaps a little more mainstream Web than elgg and Wordpress is being used by some playing with open-ish courses.

BIM as a Wordpress plugin would retain the marking/management features, but should probably pay a bit more attention to re-purposing aggregated posts. Perhaps aggregated posts could be fed into the main blog and other locations?

Wonder if there's a Wordpress plugin that already does this?  Would this be a good idea?

Am aware of this <a href="http://php.heaveninteractive.com/php-tutorials/wordpress-php-tutorials/create-your-first-wordpress-plugin-in-10-minutes/">tutorial for Wordpress plugins</a> via @marksmithers. Seems a good place to start.

Will have to wait until bim2 for Moodle is done.</p>
