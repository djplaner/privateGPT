<p>Tags: teaching</p>

<p>This Chronicle-based blog post titled <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2012/02/13/four-things-lecture-is-good-for/">"Four things lecture is good for"</a> is resonating with a lot of people. At least judging by the retweets etc.

I wonder if the article really should be title "Four things that make lectures (or any teaching mode)  better".

I can see why the post resonates. The author (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/roberttalbert">@RobertTalbert</a>) proposes four really good purposes for which a lecture is suited, including:
<ol>
  <li> Modeling thought processes. </li>
  <li> Sharing cognitive structures. </li>
  <li> Giving context. </li>
  <li> Telling stories. </li>
</ol>

I also agree with two other points he makes.

First, that the lecture is not good for information transfer. I like the argument that made that a lecture is being used to "cover material" then the design of the course has failed.  I still like this quote for defining the lecture<blockquote>A method for transferring the content of the lecturer's paper to the paper of the students without it passing through the minds of either.</blockquote> Heard this quote years ago, but can't remember the reference.

Second, that inspiration does not equal learning.

<h3>Why limit these methods to a lecture</h3>

I'm not sure I'd limit these purposes to just a lecture. For me they sum up some important aspects of teaching in general.

Too much of the teaching I see - whether in lectures or in textbooks - does not model thought processes. To often the abstract representation of much research is presented to students as a fait accompli without showing students how/why this developed.

It appears that education is especially great at developing and presenting models and frameworks to represent a problem area and expecting students to base future action on them.  I'm not sure adding a Think/Pair/Share, Jigsaw or other activity on the end is sufficient.

For me, I'll be using each of the four techniques in most of the modes of teaching I'll be using. Face-to-face lectures, online lectures, tutorials, discussion forums etc.  Posting on this blog is also part of this.</p>
