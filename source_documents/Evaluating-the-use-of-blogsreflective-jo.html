<p>The use of blogs in one of the courses I teach is now into it's fourth semester. Well past time to do explore how it's all going, evaluate some of the design decisions, and make some decisions about future developments.  In preparation for that it's time to look at some of the extant literature to look at findings and methods. The following is the first such summary and is focused on @spalm et al's
<blockquote>Palmer, S., Holt, D., &amp; Bray, S. (2008). The learning outcomes of an online reflective journal in engineering, 724–732.</blockquote>

<h3>Summary</h3>

Looks at the use of an "online reflective journal" (implemented using discussion forum in WebCT) in a 4th year engineering course. Combines a survey-based evaluation of student perceptions with "an analysis of student use of the journal…to investigate its contribution to unit learning outcomes"

Findings are
<ul>
  <li> 	Most students understood the purpose and value the journal in their learning</li>
  <li> Most read the entries of others and said this help their learning</li>
  <li> Two most useful things about the journal
       <ul> <li> The need to continuously revise course material</li>
         <li> Ability to check personal understanding against that of others</li>
       </ul>
  <li> Least useful related to problems with using WebCT - the difficulty of the interface and "problems with CMS operation". </li>
  <li> Significant contributors to final mark
       <ul>
          <li> Prior academic performance
      </li> <li> Number of journal postings
      </li> <li> Mode of study</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

The quantitative nature of this is interesting as it's something I need to do more of. If only to gain some experience of this approach and to tick the box (which is a great reason).

There is always going to be a bit of a "so what" issue with this type of thing as research.  What really does a study in a single course reveal that's new or easily transferable. But perhaps doing almost a replication addresses that somewhat.

Of course the real interest in doing this research is just to find out more about what's going on in the course, its impact and what the students think so it can inform further development.

<h3>To do</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Can I get a copy of the evaluation survey used?</li>
  <li> Can I apply the evaluation survey to past students?</li>
  <li> Do I need to get student permission to analyse the data around their use of their blogs and final results?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison with EDC3100</h3>

My impression is that prior academic performance would be the most significant factor in EDC3100. Raising the question about how much value there is in what teachers do, if prior academic performance is a big contributing factor are we "failing" the weaker student?

Question: Could the students performance on the course be included in the evaluation survey in some form?

I think mode of study might play a role. My guess is that the online students would get see the value in the blogs more than some of the on-campus students.

Question: What impact does mode of study play in EDC3100?

Given that the blog posts were only marked based on number of posts, average word count and number of links it would be interesting to explore what impact that had on the final mark.  Especially given the quote about "assessment" as a "strategic tool for creating student engagement".

Question: Exactly what type of student engagement is the assessment of the blogs in EDC3100 creating?

Question: What patterns exist in the learning journal marks?

The journaling is contributes 5% of the total course mark for each of the 3 assignments. Is there a pattern in the marks for each assignment and the final outcome?

Question: Does the medium used make any difference?

In EDC3100 students are using their own blog hosted on their choice of external service. Very different from an LMS forum. Does this make a difference? Is it more their space?

Is it seen as too difficult or a waste of time creating a blog?

Question: Is the collection of technologies used to complete this task too difficult?

To get marks students have to create their blog (e.g. Wordpress) and follow the blogs of others (Feedly, Wordpress "follow" mechanism, Wordpress reader etc). This leads to problems with creating links to posts.  E.g. students link to the post in Feedly or the Wordpress reader, not in the student's blog.

But that said, the interface is "better" (subjective) and might be seen as more realistic - not a Uni tool, something broader.

Question: Does the time of posting make any difference? What are the different patterns of posting visible? Any patterns indicating task corruption?

Palmer et al (2008)'s journal is essentially a weekly task. In EDC3100 students need to post at least 3 posts a week to get full marks. There is no specific direction as to what or when to post. What patterns are there?

Question:  How does the perception of reflection/journaling in the discipline impact thoughts?

Palmer et al (2008) describe how a work journal is a common practice for engineers. Hence doing this in the course can be linked to professional practice.

The same doesn't apply to the teaching profession. While reflection is seen as important, there's doesn't appear to be the accepted practice of regularly keeping a work journal.</p>
