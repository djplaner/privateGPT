<p>Tags: Uncategorized, webfuse</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, most of my work and research over the last ten years has been in someway associated with <a href="http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/">Webfuse</a>.  It's the focus of my PhD and many of my <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Papers_and_Books/">publications </a> with the intent of attempting to develop an information systems design theory for e-learning.  <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Papers_and_Books/formulation.pdf">Jones and Gregor (2006)</a> provide one explanation.

There are a lot of things of which I am proud about with respect Webfuse.  There's equally a lot that I'm not.

One of the aspects that is lacking is picked up in a <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/294">recent IRRODL article</a> by Adrian Kirkwood and Linda Price (I actually met Linda, briefly, at the ITiCSE conference in Barcelona in 1996).

The major point of the paper is, I believe, this
<blockquote>
In particular, we oppose CPD that concentrates on the individual teacher and their use of ICT. Instead, we contend that professional development should focus upon the scholarship of teaching and learning, and must also reflect the wider organisational context within which ICT is managed and used.
</blockquote>

A major limitation of Webfuse is that it was never accompanied by an organisational level process that emphasised the scholarship of teaching and learning.  Though the Webfuse team did attempt to place some consideration of the organisational context rather than just on the individual teacher it did not, and with the state of the organisation, could not be supported through a concerted effort to encourage wider adoption of scholarship of teaching and learning amongst staff.

Consequently, most of the "learning" amongst staff about the use of technology to support learning and teaching (and L&amp;T in general) was an example of single-loop learning.  Using the technology to be more efficient rather than questioning the underlying goals, strategies and assumptions.</p>
