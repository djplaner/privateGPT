<p>Tags: elearning, Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites</p>

<p>I'm becoming interested in the notion of <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=15">Web 2.0 course sites</a> as the next step in the evolutionary development of Webfuse.

This details my first experiment with <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a> as part of that process.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Video">Google Video</a> has more detail on competing services, background and drawbacks of Google Video.

<strong>The idea</strong>

The idea being (am practicing my 30 second blurb on the topic) that instead of a University's servers hosting all the software and content for a course that the course site make use of the multitude of free web-based services services.  The University's servers would then provide the "glue" that connects these services and any University specific services.

The point being to
<ul>
  <li> Reduce cost
         The university doesn't pay for the maintenance, network bandwidth and other costs associated with hosting the content and services.
  </li>
  <li>  Improve quality
          Is any University IT department ever going to provide a service as reliable and speedy as Google regardless of location?
  </li>
  <li> Increase flexibility
        The reduction in infrastructure costs is one factor that could make the University's elearning strategy more flexible.  i.e. "we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this server, we can't change yet"
  </li>
</ul>

<strong>What I did</strong>

In the first half of 2006 I was the coordinator for &lt;a href="http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T1/COIT11134/</a>COIT11134, Procedural Programming</a>.  As part of that I used <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU's</a> video-streaming infrastructure to record my lectures.  (I recognise that in a perfect world there are all sorts of pedagogical reasons why this is a bad thing, but there were many contextual reasons why doing this was a good thing).

The <a href="http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T1/COIT11134/Resources/Lectures/">lectures page</a> is the end result.

I took the downloadable video of the first lecture and uploaded it to Google Video.  Here's the process
<ul>
  <li> Login with a Google account.
        I already have one thanks to my use of the <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google news reader</a>.
  </li>
  <li> Fill in a form that requires the video file, title, description and then hit submit </li>
  <li> The upload takes a while </li>
</ul>

In my case the upload appears to have failed.  The browser message I received was "error occured in uploading".  No other information was apparent.  Apparently, according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Video">Wikipedia page</a> this is a known problem.

But not long after I received an email saying it was successful and including the url for the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7886702771787666570">Google Video version of the lecture</a>.

<strong>The result</strong>

Some observations on the result, particularly in comparison to the CQU services
<ul>
  <li> Larger video picture - at least double the size </li>
  <li> Startup speed that is comprable.
         Google is a bit slower, but not significantly.  This should be no surprise
       since I'm doing this test on a computer on CQU's LAN.  This same test from a computer on an external network should show Google Video being quite a bit faster.
  </li>
  <li> Much better cross platform support
     I'm on a Mac.  Most of the CQU video is quite problematic to run on the Mac, given its Windows/wmv emphasis.  Even the quicktime version doesn't work well.  Google video works great.  Google uses a <a href="http://video.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=27998&amp;topic=8696">Flash based player</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

My conclusion is that there are some benefits to giving this idea further consideration.</p>
