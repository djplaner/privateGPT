<p>Tags: Chapter 5, elearning, indicators, phd, thesis, Uncategorized, webfuse</p>

<p><p>The following presents details of feature adoption by courses using the Webfuse system from 1997 through 2009. It presents the data generated by the work <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/07/01/examining-feature-adoption-slightly-better-approach/">described in the last post</a>.</p>
<p>No real analysis or propositions, mostly just the data.  Analysis is next step.</p>

<h3>How features are grouped</h3>

<p>To provide some level of Webfuse independence I've used the model developed by Malikowski et al (2007) and represented in the following image.</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3858116950/" title="Reworked Malikowski model by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Reworked Malikowski model" height="180" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2512/3858116950_aa68b05446_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<p>Essentially, each Webfuse feature was assigned to one of four categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Transmitting content. </li>
  <li> Interactions. </li>
  <li> Evaluating students. </li>
  <li> Evaluating courses. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Feature adoption</h3>

<p>The following table shows the results. The adoption rate is shown as a percentage of Webfuse courses that used a particular feature category.</p>

<h3>When is a course a Webfuse course?</h3>

<p>The most surprising aspect of the previous table is that some of the percentages are greater than 100%.  How do you get more than 100% of the Webfuse courses adopting a feature?</p>
<p>Due to the nature of Webfuse, its features, and the political context it is possible that a course could use a Webfuse feature without having a Webfuse course website.  Webfuse was never the official institutional LMS, that honour fell upon WebCT and then Blackboard. However, a number of the features provided by Webfuse were still of use to folk using WebCT or Blackboard.</p>
<p>
For the purpose of the above, a Webfuse course is a course that has a Webfuse course site. </p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Each of the following will show a graph of each feature category and offer some brief notes and initial propositions based on the data.</p>

<h4>Transmit content</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396063/" title="Adoption of content transmission features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Adoption of content transmission features Webfuse 1997 through 2009" height="145" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4750396063_af92f87ac1_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<p>Background</p>
<ul>
  <li> 100% of Webfuse course sites had content transmission. </li>
  <li> From the 2nd half of 2001 these were automatically created. </li>
  <li> Feature adoption above only includes where teaching academics have placed additional content onto the course site.</li>
  <li> Main Webfuse features in this category are: course web pages, uploading various files and using the course announcements/update features. </li>
</ul>
<p>Observations and propositions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The automated and expanded default course site introduction in 2001 appears correlated with an increase in use. However, that could simply be broader acceptance of the Web.</li>
  <li> Even at most accepted, almost 30% of staff teaching courses did not place additional content on the course site.  This could be seen as bad, 30% didn't do anything, or good, 30% could focus on other tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interactions</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396157/" title="Adoption of interaction features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Adoption of interaction features Webfuse 1997 through 2009" height="145" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4750396157_e707bf34d8_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<p>Background:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Percentage adoption in 1997 through 1999 is probably higher as significant numbers of courses used Internet mailing lists. However, records of these aren't tightly integrated with Webfuse course sites.</li>
  <li> The 1998 archives have been found, so the table above shows 48.6% of courses having mailing lists. </li>
  <li> From 2000 onwards Webfuse default sites included a web-based mail archive of mailing lists. <li>
  <li> Features include: interactive chat rooms, web-based discussion forums, email-merge, <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BAM</a> and web-based archives of mailing lists.</li>
  <li> The push over 100% in 2007 onwards comes from a combination of more widespread use of mailing lists/discussion forums in default course sites and broader adoption of the email merge facility by non-Webfuse courses. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluate students</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4751040284/" title="Adoption of student evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Adoption of student evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009" height="145" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4751040284_5e87456c58_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<p>Background:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Main traditional features are online quizzes and online assignment submission and management. </li>
  <li> Other non-traditional student evaluation features include an academic misconduct application, assignment extension system, informal review of grade system etc. </li>
  <li> About 2005 onwards some of the non-traditional features became institutional systems. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluate courses</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396289/" title="Adoption of course evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Adoption of course evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009" height="145" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4750396289_66206f7df8_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>

<p>Background:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2000 and before primary evaluation is via web-based forms with a bit of course barometer usage. </li>
  <li> Post 2001 course barometer becomes standard in all Webfuse courses. </li>
  <li> But not all courses have contributions. The percentages only include a barometer feature if someone has posted a comment to it.  If measured as having a course barometer, then figure would be 100% from 2001 through 2004/5.</li>
  <li> Spike in usage in 2008 comes from small institutional project using barometer in non-Webfuse courses. </li>
  <li> Similar spike in 2002 comes from active enouragement of barometer idea. </li>
</ul></p>
