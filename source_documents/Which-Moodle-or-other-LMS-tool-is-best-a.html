<p>Tags: bim2, elearning, moodle</p>

<p>A question for those with experience of Moodle or other LMS tools/plugins/services etc<blockquote>Which tools do a really good job of embedded support/training?</blockquote>

i.e. assume the tools is used to support a fairly complex task, but if I'm a first time user of the tool I can access all that I need to know about using the tool effectively from within the tool itself.  I don't need to visit the institutional e-learning support site, contact help desk or Google resources placed online by others.

A "really good job" might be judged on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to,
<ul>
  <li> Clear instructions that get you underway quickly. </li>
  <li> Well structured, scaffolded support that minimises the need for calling helpdesk. </li>
  <li> Instructions that move beyond simple technical "how-tos" into offering pedagogical insights. </li>
  <li> Some aspect of how it supports the people using it is different from the run-of-the-mill. </li>
</ul>

Also, feel free to throw in suggestions of any software in general (most modern, quality computer games are probably good examples) or literature.

<h3>Context</h3>

I'm finally getting started on my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/05/12/moodle-bim-reflective-journals-and-tpack-suggestions-for-moving-beyond/">Moodlemoot'AU 2013 presentation</a> and am thinking about how <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a> can be improved.

Improving the support BIM provides out of the box has long been an aim. Mostly because I think most of the tools I use don't do a particularly good job and most of the additional supports (e.g. separate training sessions or separate websites) provided by institutions are also <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/04/28/how-knowledge-workers-like-to-learn-and-implications-for-bim-and-lms-design/">not as good as they could be</a>.

This idea has been percolating for more than a few years originally proposed back in 2010 as <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/10/06/making-the-lms-more-like-the-globe-theatre-distributed-cognition-the-extended-mind-and-moodle/">"Making the LMS more like the Globe Theatre"</a>.

So, I'm after ideas of where it's been done well.</p>
