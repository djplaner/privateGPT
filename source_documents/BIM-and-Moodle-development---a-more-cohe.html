<p>Tags: bim, moodle, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Today has been a fairly frustrating today with a mixture of organisational "stuff" and an increasing level of annoyance at the state of the public documentation around Moodle development slowing down <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/12/14/getting-back-into-bim-summary-and-way-forward/">BIM</a> development.  That state is essentially with stuff all over the place, no coherent path through it and regularly discrepancies between advice from different sources, or sometimes the same. But that's the nature of documentation and open source projects.</p>
<p>The one bright spot today has been stumbling over <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/moodle-1-9-extension-development/book">this book</a> which appears to fill the hole.  Even if it is commercial.  Having said that, the realease as writing nature of the book and some other aspects (donations to moodle) seems to indicate an enlightened company.  On first skim the book looks good. Time will tell.  Though, I am guessing that due to the nature of the type of book, complexity of the task and that it's still being written there will be some rough edges (already submitted my first errata), or areas not covered.</p>
<p>Bugger, small problem.  The one aspect I'm currently struggling with (use of moodleform_mod within a Module to create a new form - i.e. not in mod_form.php) is covered in their example.  However, the authors have used moodleform and not moodleform_mod as the base/abstract class.  I thought that was a no no?</p>
<p>Well, if I take their approach and use moodleform.  It appears to get past the syntax errors being caused by my lack of understanding.  Perhaps I just need to progress with that until future enlightenment.</p>
<p>So some progress today.</p></p>
