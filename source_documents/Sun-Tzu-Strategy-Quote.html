<p><blockquote>The essence of strategy is the close view of distant things and the distant view of close things -- Sun Tzu</blockquote>

My interest in emergent/agile approaches means I'm not a fan of strategy and/or strategic appraoches currently used in most business.

I think there is possibilities to use this quote to bring out my disquiet with this approach, at least in some contexts.
<ul>
  <li> close view of distant things<br />
         Assumes you can achieve such a thing.  Bounded rationality, rapid change etc imply you can't, or if you do it will be imperfect.
  </li>
  <li> distant view of close things<br />
         Implies too little knowledge of existing practice so that strategy can become unconnected and difficult to implement.
  </li>
</ul>

A start</p>
