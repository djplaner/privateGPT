<p>Consider this a plea for suggestions. In particular, consider it a plea for workarounds that I can implement quickly (and painlessly).

<h3>The problem</h3>

I have a Moodle course site. It has a range of activities, many with a page or two of text that sets the context and explains the task. The image below shows what the activities for one week look like.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/8531981481/" title="Week 1 learning path by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img alt="Week 1 learning path" height="290" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8373/8531981481_1f0719ef8b_n.jpg" width="320" /></a>

Now this works fine if a student works sequentially through the activities.  It tracks what they've completed etc.

It fails miserably when they want to revisit the page about "X".  They have to remember in which week "X" was talked about, under which activity "X" was addressed.

I have problems doing this and I wrote the stuff.

<h3>The "web way" solution</h3>

If this was any other website, we'd follow the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-and-you-may-find/">advice</a> of Jakob Nielsen<blockquote>Search is one of the most important user interface elements in any large website. As a rule of thumb, sites with more than about 200 pages should offer search.</blockquote>

The "web way" solution would be to have a search engine. But the Moodle installation of the University I teach the course for doesn't appear to provide this functionality. I believe the only way this can occur is to allow Google to have access to all courses on the site.  While there may be reasons for this, it's not a solution I'm pushing just to solve my problem.

How can I provide my students with a search function?  How can I make my course site <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/09/07/one-example-of-industrial-e-learning-as-on-the-web-not-of-the-web/">"of the web" and not "on the web"</a>?

I have heard mention made of being saved by repositories.  i.e. Moodle is not a content hosting platform and doesn't try to be. If you want searchable content, place it in a repository.  The trouble is we're not talking here about large documentation.  Just a lot of small pages that are closely wrapped around specific learning activities in Moodle. I'm yet to see an information repository integration that works as seamlessly as I'd expect.

<h3>My interim solution</h3>

In the absence of any brilliant ideas, it appears that the only way to do this is to create a duplicate website that is actually "of the web".  i.e. one that is indexed by Google.  I'm thinking probably a blog with pages set up to match the weeks and other components.

Some have suggested providing the pages as a PDF document (or three). The problem with this is that there is web content (videos, animations etc) embedded throughout. Producing a print document would allow folk to search, but then they wouldn't have access to the web content (unless they clicked on a link etc).

Producing a second website is by no means a perfect solution, some of its limitations include
<ul>
  <li> Extra workload for me. </li>
  <li> Large potential to create confusion amongst the students<br />e.g. which website do I visit? Which website has the correct content? Do I need to check both websites?</li>
  <li> Loss of some Moodle functionality.<br />The course currently uses the Moodle activity completion functionality to allow students to track their completion, but also as part of the assessment. If students start working through the blog version of the website it will lead to "But I already did that activity!" problems. </li>
</ul>

Surely there has to be a better solution?</p>
