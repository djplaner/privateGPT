<p>Tags: quotes</p>

<p>Came across <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/langwitches/learning-how2learn-change-rethinkamplify">this presentation, "Learning how to learn"</a> (a bit ra-ra, but covers many of the bases for changes in the world and implications for learning). It includes this quote
<blockquote>If you focus on results, you will never change. If you focus on change, you will get results -- Jack Dixon</blockquote>

The quote is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22If+you+focus+on+results%2C+you+will+never+change.+If+you+focus+on+change%2C+you+will+get+results.%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1">used widely</a>, but I can't find the original citation.

<h3>Ateleological connection</h3>

This quote resonates with my view that there needs to be more <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/25/teleological-and-ateleological-processes/">ateleological processes</a> around organisations - especially schools and universities - and less of the traditional teleological processes.

A teleological process focuses on results. It defines what the goal is and measures progress against movement toward that goal. If you aren't helping achieve that goal you're wrong. Such an approach is a poor match for the current context of most organisations. It assumes that your existing schemata will allow you to think of what the future needs, that what will be required in the future won't change before you get there, and that you can actually get a large group of people (e.g. academics) to work together for the same goal. Focus on the results, and you will never change.

An ateleological process focuses on the next small change to make within the very local context and focuses on making those changes fast and continuous whilst keeping in synch with what is going on in the world and the organisation. Focus on the change and you will get results.</p>
