<p>Tags: curriculumMapping, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>It's time to think about the reality of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/curriculum-mapping/">curriculum mapping idea</a> that's been kicking around.  i.e. how hard/impossible would it be to implement this idea in Moodle.</p>
<p>As part of developing BIM I came across the fact that Moodle already supports Outcomes.  Something that has some connections with the idea of curriculum mapping. This post is about finding out some more about outcomes as they already existing in Moodle. In fact, it's basically a look at two videos about how to use them.</p>
<p>The following points to the two videos I've looked at and has some quick notes I made as I was watching.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ul>
  <li> Outcomes are by default not enabled at a site wide level. They need to be enabled to work at the course level.</li>
  <li> Outcomes can be created at site and course levels. </li>
  <li> They can be associated with any activity or resource. </li>
  <li> Outcomes have a scale.</li>
  <li> Once created, they automatically appear when adding a resource or activity. </li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be some room for improvement for the specifics of curriculum mapping (e.g. grouping of different outcomes, attributes etc) it seems that the basics for this approach exist already.  A prototype should be really easy.</p>


<h3>How to use Moodle outcomes</h3>

<p>Outcomes are in the Grades part of the site admin menu.  And need to be enabled there.  The outcomes themselves are also set at the site level - not course!!!???</p>
<p>Outcomes have short and full names, description and a scale.</p>
<p>Outcomes appear in the course administration menu.  Then you select from the site list to use them in a course.</p>
<p>Ahh, can create course level/specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Should work with activities.  Outcomes appear when adding?</p>
<p>When grading an assignment can see outcomes.</p>
<p>Outcomes do appear in the gradebook.

<h3>Introduction to Scales and outcomes</h3>

<p>Adds a scale, within a test course.</p>
<p>Outcomes added also within the course, but as part of the grade.  Can have multiple outcomes.</p>
<p>Also used to create an assignment.</p>
<p>Outcomes can be applied to activities and resources.</p></p>
