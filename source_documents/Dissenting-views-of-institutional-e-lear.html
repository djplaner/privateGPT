<p>Tags: elearning</p>

<p>The following two quotes are talking about the e-learning context at the same institution at about the same time (2009 through about 2011).

The great<blockquote>no <em>name of institution removed</em> interviewees commented on the impact of technology. It is probable that since the institution had undergone a large review and renewal of technology in the learning management system where processes to support academics were put in place and where academics were included in decision making and empowered to change and upskill, negative attitudes towards the general impact of technology were not an issue for staff. One can hypothesise that these issues were principally resolved.</blockquote>

The not so great<blockquote>During training sessions … several people made suggestions and raised issues with the structure and use of Moodle. As these suggestions and issues were not recorded and the trainers did not feed them back to the programmers … This resulted in frustration for academic staff when teaching with Moodle for the first time as the problems were not fixed before teaching started.....[t]he longer the communication chain, the less likely it was that academic users’ concerns would be communicated correctly to the people who could fix the problems</blockquote>

Seems to be a problem of communication somewhere in there.

I wonder which view was closer to the truth (whatever that is)?  Given that the first quote is from a nationally funded research project (the second from a peer-reviewed journal publication), I wonder what implications this has for the practice of institutional e-learning? Or, what it is that institutions say about their practice of e-learning?</p>
