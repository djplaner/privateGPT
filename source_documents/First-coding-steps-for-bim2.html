<p>Tags: bim, bim2, Uncategorized</p>

<p>The following records some of the initial steps in actually coding bim2. It includes
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#name">A new name?</a>;</li>
  <li> <a href="#newrepo">The new github repo for bim2</a>; </li>
  <li> <a href="#resources">Resources for Moodle 2 module development</a>; and</li>
  <li> <a href="#steps">Initial coding steps for bim2</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="name"></a>
<h3>A new name?</h3>

bim2 is going to be very different from version 1 of bim. Beyond working for a different version of Moodle, I'm hoping bim2 will be a significant improvement in terms of code design and provide a foundation for some interesting stuff. Consequently, I want to keep the distinction between the two systems clear.

Hence, as you can probably guess, I'm using the title <strong>bim2</strong> for version 2.0. This matches the name of the github repo and subsequently the directory on the Moodle server. Am hoping the consistency will work well.....time will tel.

<a name="newrepo"></a>
<h3>New github repo for bim2</h3>

The code for bim2 will be/is available from a <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/bim2">new github repository</a>. There's only the <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/bim2/blob/master/README">README</a> there at the moment, however, as I progress I will be updating the repo.

I'm using github, because the experience with bim was just so simple and effective.

<a name="resources"></a>
<h3>Resources for Moodle 2 development</h3>

The first step is finding out just how different Moodle 2 module development is from Moodle 1.9. My vague understanding is that it isn't that different, however, I am planning to start from scratch with bim2, rather than port BIM into Moodle 2.  The main reason for this is that I want to experiment with a better design for the structure of bim2.

What I'm really after is enough information to get a test/dummy Moodle 2 module up and going ASAP. The skeleton/foundation for bim2.

<a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Category:Moodle_2.0">Category:Moodle 2.0</a> seems to be the place for an overview of available documentation.

As with my initial Moodle experience, I am finding it hard to get my head around the apparently disjointed collection of resources and insights on the moodle.org site.  It appears that the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:NEWMODULE_Documentation">NEWMODULE.zip</a> approach might work with Moodle 2.0.  So, I'll move onto that.

<a name="steps"></a>
<h3>Initial coding steps for bim2</h3>

So, this has essentially become the process for following the NEWMODULE.zip readme and getting a dummy bim2 up and going.
<ol>
  <li> Get all the files NEWMODULE.zip files into the bim2 directory. </li>
  <li> Change <em>newmodule</em> to <em>bim2</em> in all the files. </li>
  <li> Rename the lang/en_utf8/newmodule.php file to bim2.php. </li>
  <li> Log into Moodle as admin. </li>
  <li> Remember about modifying version.php to have a version number that represents the current date.<br />Not sure I need this, at the moment, but I got bitten by this mistake with BIM.</li>
   <li> Success "bim2" installed. </li>
  <li> Let's add a course and see if I can add an activity?<br />
         Mmm, not liking the manual enrol for users in a course. No obvious save/submit/ok button when finished enrolling.  I have to hit the close window widget, which (for me at least) suggests losing changes.</li>
  <li> Yep, it's there, but error about database table modules. This matches the instructions in NEWMODULE.zip.  Need to modify the module's tables.  Ahhh, death by XMLDB.... </li>
  <li> The current plan is to re-use the existing BIM database tables.  Let's see if I can brave XMLDB to do that.  All done.  Success. </li>
</ol>

That will do for now.  Next step will be to start actively modifying the NEWMODULE stuff into bim2 specific code.</p>
