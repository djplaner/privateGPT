This is a continuation of my attempt to develop a list of the assumptions underpinning existing practice around learning and teaching at universities which the concepts surrounding the Personal Learning Environments (PLE) term bring into question.  The list started with <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/12/what-are-the-assumptions-which-pleslearning-20-etc-overthrow/">this post</a> and is continuing (all the posts should be linked from the bottom of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/12/what-are-the-assumptions-which-pleslearning-20-etc-overthrow/">original post</a>).

<h3>"Big" systems</h3>


<p>
Since the mid to late 1990s most higher education institutions have been adopting the "big" system fad. The "big" system fad is the adoption of really expensive information systems that do everything. What I call the <strong>"one ring to rule them all"</strong> approach.</p>
<p>
The positive spin on these systems is that they are "enterprise" systems. They embody best practice. They promise a single system to unite all required tasks.  It's all neat and tidy and a load of crap.
</p>
<p>
Most of this came out of interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_systems">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a> systems which grew out of systems to manage planning for manufacturing systems.  These morphed into systems to manage the entire operations of organisations.
</p>
<p>
Around the mid-1990s these started being applied to universities. Around the same time learning management systems (LMS) arrived on the seen.  They were soon sold as "enterprise" learning management systems. Single systems to manage all of the "e-learning" of an organisation.
</p>
<p>
Senior management like these big systems because of the promise.  Buy the "big" systems and all your problems will be over.  You won't have to do anything else. You will be able to get the entire organisation using this system. Everything will be consistent. You will be able to understand it, because it is simple, and subsequently manage and control it.
</p>
<p>
Information Technology units like "big" systems, at least at the beginning, because, for various reasons, it gives IT control. They are given the power to require people to comply and use the big system because it is so expensive everyone must use it.
</p>
<p>
Because it is expensive it is important. Because it is an IT system that is important, the IT unit is then important to the business.
</p>

<h3>Problems with big systems</h3>

<p>
The Wikipedia page on ERPs offers a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_systems#Disadvantages">good list of the disadvantages</a> of these systems. Many of these become hugely problematic when a "big" system is applied to contexts outside of its sweet spot.  i.e. contexts similar to manufacturing.  Contexts which are not standardised in process, components or outputs (e.g. learning and teaching) suffer under the weight of a "big" system.
</p>
<p>
Some examples, drawing on the disadvantages listed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_systems#Disadvantages">wikipedia page</a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Customisation of the ERP software is limited <br />
Standard best practice advice with "big" systems is do not customise.  This means your organisation and everyone in it must use the system in exactly the same way as everyone else. It is almost impossible to customise the system for local contextual needs.
  </li>
  <li> Loss of competitive advantage<br />
This means your organisation cannot differentiate itself from any other competitor that is using the same "big" system.
  </li>
  <li> Once established, switching costs are very high<br />
They cost so much to implement you can't easily change. This leads to "stable systems" drag (Truex, Baskerville and Klein, 1999) where the organisation struggles against the problems of an inappropriate system because it is too expensive/difficult to change.  Eventually the huge investment of resources is made and the change is made.  Usually to another "big" system and the problem starts all over again.
<p>
Supposedly open source "big" systems is the solution to this problem. Sorry, no it isn't. The cost of the actual software, which is the bit which is "free" with open source software, is the smallest part of the cost of a "big" system.  You end up saving this very minor portion of the cost and still retain all the other problems of a "big" system.

  </li>
  <li> The system may be too complex for the needs of the customer<br />
A University I know of selected Peoplesoft as its ERP.  The Peoplesoft ERP system grew out of human resource management. It was, I'm told, known for being a good HRM system. From there it grew to have a number of other components added - finance, student administration etc.  Guess which part of the ERP this university did <strong>not</strong> implement - the HRM system.  It was too hard given existing contextual constraints.
  <p>
  How much of the functionality of an "enterprise" LMS is actually used by the staff and students of a university? If my experience is anything to go by, bugger all.
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The biggest problem with these systems is that they attempt to do everything. This means that a single supplier, or in the case of open source - a single community, must provide all of the necessary functionality.  If you want a <em>kerfuffle widget</em> for your "big" system you have to wait for the vendor/community to develop a <em>kerfuffle widget</em>
</p>

<h3>Small pieces, loosely joined</h3>

<p>
The PLE concept builds on the concept of <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">small pieces loosely joined</a>. That is, there are lots of different Web 2.0 tools, all (most?) of them concentrate on doing on thing, providing one service.  <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> helps folk share photos, <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> helps folk blog etc. Each of these systems is loosely joined through a combination of feeds and open APIs.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/">home page of my blog</a>.  Down the right hand column you will see two collections of photos.  One collection taken by me and another containing those photos on Flickr that I've used in my presentations.  How do I get these into my blog?
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Upload them into my account on Flickr/tag them as a favourite in Flickr. </li>
  <li> Use <a href="http://flickrriver.com/">FlickrRiver</a> to create two HTML badges of random photos.  One with my the most interesting photos I've taken, the other from my favourites.  </li>
  <li> Use <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress'</a> features to add the HTML for these two badges to my blog. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these tools do one thing well.  They are loosely joined via an open API (Flickr to FlickrRiver) and HTML/"API" (FlickrRiver to Wordpress).
</p>
<p>
Imagine how much effort, how much expense and how long you would have to wait for the vendor/community of a "big" system to provide that functionality.  Does anyone think that such a tool would be easier to use and have more functionality than Flickr, FlickrRiver and Wordpress?
</p>

<h4>Moving beyond the expert designer</h4>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/me_haridas/399049455/"><img align="left" alt="Big Ben" border="0" height="240" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/124/399049455_574a55657b_m.jpg" width="184" /></a>
<p>
Another major advantage of this approach is that it enables the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/15/expert-designer-another-assumption-ples-question/">"death of the expert designer"</a>.  Adding the FlickrRiver HTML badge to get my random collection of Flickr photos did not require me to go to the software designers of Wordpress and ask them to add the ability to add random photos to my blog.
</p>
<p>
I could do it myself.
</p>
<p>
This removes a bottleneck within organisations.
</p>

<h4>Not without its problems</h4>

<p>
As others have <a href="http://plunkers.blogspot.com/2005/12/simple-tools-small-pieces-loosely.html">pointed out</a> the idea of small pieces loosely joined is not without its problems. These have to be looked at and worked out. Based on the work I've done I don't see the potential problems as unsolvable and I certainly see the benefits far outweighing the problems.
