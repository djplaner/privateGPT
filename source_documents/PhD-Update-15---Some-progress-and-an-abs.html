<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Some progress made this week, but it comes as a prelude to a week in which not much, if anything will be done.  This week, after a couple of days at work, the family and I are off to visit Longreach, my sister and her family. We won't get back until after my normal "updates" day. So, I'll miss the updates for next week.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/14/phd-update-14-moving-to-a-new-day/">Last week</a> I said that I would</p>
<ul><li> Complete the process component. - <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li> Make significant progress on the People component. - not even started. </li>
</ul>
<p>I've just posted the last section of the Process component (<a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/21/lessons-from-process-for-university-e-learning/">Lessons from process</a>) and completed the other section earlier in the week (<a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/19/learning-and-teaching-processes/">Learning and teaching processes</a>).</p>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>As suggested above, it's likely to be bugger all.  However, any work I do attempt will be focused on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Making some progress on the People component of the Ps Framework.</li>
</ul></p>
