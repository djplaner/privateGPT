<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>A <a href="http://damosworld.wordpress.com/about-damien/">friend and colleague</a> is engaged in some thinking about <a href="http://damosworld.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/connectivism-and-the-importance-of-context-an-example/">connectivism and its relationship with other learning theories</a>. Thinking that is informed, sparked and perhaps somewhat unanswered by <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=116">a post from George Siemens</a>.</p>
<p>Damien and I talked briefly about this today and I let fly with an ill-informed opinion. I thought I'd share it here and hope that someone will point out the errors in my assumptions. I've been aware of the connectivism stuff for a while but have not taken the time to fully understand it.  One of my tasks post the PhD thesis. I am, however, a potential fan of the approach as the following may indicate.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a complex question and this little post will not cover everything (not the least because I'm somewhat clueless in the topic).  In fact, I'm focusing on just one point. This post is perhaps the best example in my blog of me <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/15/getting-half-baked-ideas-out-there-improving-research-and-the-academy/">sharing a half-baked idea</a>. </p>
<p>Fire away!</p>

<h3>What's a difference with connectivism?</h3>

<p>I suggest that a major difference between connectivism and the other learning theories (broadly behaviourism, cognitivsm and constructivism) is that connectivism is based on assumptions that actually match what happens in the human brain.  i.e. the functioning of the brain matches the assumptions within connectivism. As learning must, I think, involve the brain somewhat a theory of learning that connects with how the brain operates is important.</p>
<p>Behaviorism assumes that learning is a black box. It doesn't even attempt to understand it.  It focuses on what we can see.</p>
<p>Cognitivism assumes the brain/rationality works a bit like a computer. The brain is a symbol processor.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of constructivism making any specific claims connecting learning with how the brain works. It just assumes we learn by constructing meaning, but doesn't mention how the brain does this.</p>
<p>See what I mean about me being clueless in this area yet?</p>
<p>Where as my understanding of connectivism is that it is closely related to modern ideas about how the brain works.</p>
<p>Gotta go</p></p>
