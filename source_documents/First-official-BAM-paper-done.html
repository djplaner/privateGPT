<p>Tags: bam, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BAM - Blog Aggregation Management</a> is a project I started in early 2006 to play around with two sets of ideas:</p>
<ol>
  <li> learning; and <br /> Building on some ideas of using blogs for individual student reflective journals in an attempt to increase the visibility of their progress and enable increased levels of student/teacher interaction.</li>
  <li> technical.<br />Extending one of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/the-design-of-an-integrated-online-learning-environment/">initial ideas of Webfuse</a> ("maximise adaptability by concentrating on providing the infrastructure required to integrate existing and yet to be developed online learning tools") into the wonderful world of Web 2.0.</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial experiment in the second half of 2006 has been the topic of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/blogs-reflective-journals-and-aggregation-an-initial-experiment/">a report for a website</a> and some blog posts. However, late last year <a href="http://fabie.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/staff.do?site=536&amp;sid=LUCKJ">Jo</a> and I submitted a paper to <a href="http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/">EdMedia'2009</a>. It was accepted, but I or the reviewers were not entirely happy with the paper, so some changes have been made.</p>
<p>Consequently, the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/blog-aggregation-management-reducing-the-aggravation-of-managing-student-blogging/">next to final version</a> of the paper is now available. It's better than the version that was accepted, but still not great. At least it tells the story with a bit of reflection. </p>
<p>Not a great paper but it's one of two Jo will present in Hawaii.</p>
<p>As for the future of BAM, that all depends on what's happening with work. At the very least BAM is taking a back seat to the PhD, for a while.</p></p>
