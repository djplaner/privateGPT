<p>Tags: bad, set</p>

<p>I've just started reading <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/genomics-bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/systems-view-life-unifying-vision">Capra &amp; Luigi Luisi (2014)</a>, in large part because I think that the shift in scientific thinking they apparently describe in the book may have some useful insights for <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/#badset">BAD/SET mindsets</a> and trying to understand and improve digital learning.

In the first chapter they propose <blockquote>two tendencies - the self-assertive and the integrative - are both essential aspects of all living systems. Neither of them is intrinsically good or bad. What is good, or healthy, is a dynamic balance; what is bad, or unhelathy, is imblance - overemphasis on one tendency and neglect of the other. When we look at our modern industrial culture, we see that we have overemphasized the self-assertive and neglected the integrative tendencies</blockquote>

A perspective that echoes the point <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/">@damoclarky and I made</a> in conjunction with digital learning and the BAD/SET mindsets

Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014) then present a table that compare and contrast the two tendencies and their "thinking" and "values".  I've split it into two separate

<table>
<caption>"Thinking" comparison of self-assertive and integrative tendencies (adapted from Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014)</caption>
  <tr>
    <th> Self-assertive </th>
    <th> Integrative </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> rational </td>
    <td> intuitive </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> analysis </td>
    <td> synthesis </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> reductionist </td>
    <td> holistic </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> linear </td>
    <td> nonlinear </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
<caption>"Values" comparison of self-assertive and integrative tendencies (adapted from Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014)</caption>
  <tr>
    <th> Self-assertive </th>
    <th> Integrative </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> expansion </td>
    <td> conservation </td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> competition </td>
    <td> cooperation </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> quantity </td>
    <td> quality </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> domination </td>
    <td> partnership </td>
  </tr>
</table>

They go onto suggest that
<ul>
  <li> self-assertive values are generally associated with men </li>
  <li> the self-assertive tendency is most effectively implemented within hierarchy </li>
  <li> the integrative tendency aims more towards empowering others </li>
  <li> best achieved within a network, rather than a hierarchy </li>
</ul>
