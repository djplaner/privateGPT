<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Number 12 of the weekly PhD updates and the first one that is late - this was meant to be done yesterday afternoon.  Better late than never. This has been a fairly positive week, some progress made and more importantly I may have learned a small lessons (and put it into practice) about the size and amount of stuff I'm trying to put into these sections of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>I may not get a chance to apply this lessons a great deal in the coming week. Most of it will be spent on a holiday.</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>

<p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/15/phd-update-11-very-short-week/">Last week</a> I said the aim would be to</p>
<ul>
  <li> Have completed and posted the section on “Place”. - <strong>DONE</strong><br />The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/17/lessons-from-place/">last section</a> was put up fairly early in the week. I'm not all that happy with this section. But it might be close to "good enough".</li>
  <li> Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”. - <strong>DONE</strong><br />This was the major task this week that resulted in <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/20/purpose-a-component-of-the-ps-framework/">this post</a>. It's much shorter than the other sections. To some extent this is due to the nature of the component, but mostly my aim not to write another paper for each section.</li>
  <li> Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy. - started<br />I ended up starting work on the Process component of the Ps Framework. It flowed nicely from Purpose (connection with plan/purpose driven design processes).  I've written papers on the question of process, so I have 80+ pages of thoughts and quotes that I'm re-organising into a section.  A start has been made.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a few blog posts, somewhat related to the thesis but not worth recounting here.</p>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>With most of next week consumed in a holiday, I don't expect to make a great deal of progress. The aim will be to</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete the process component, or as much as I can. </li>
</ul></p>
