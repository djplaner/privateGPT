<p>Warger (2003) (amongst others) makes the claim
<blockquote>
Best yet, the learning materials and student progress data that accumulate through use of the CMS become an ever-increasing source value to institutions of higher education. </blockquote>

Questions that arise
<ol>
  <li> Does the progress data actually provide anything useful for organisations?
  </li>
  <li> Is it the only source of such data?  What about logging into the computer network, using other administrative portals?
  </li>
  <li> How effectively can organisations gain access to this data? Are there tools available?  Who do these tools "serve", teaching staff, managers? </li>
  <li> Are there any organisations actually using this data? <br />
  I know CQU isn't really, at least not beyond the odd academic.  Recently CQU discovered that some of the logging functionality in Blackboard hadn't even been turned on.  I have seen some papers (e.g. ASCILITE 2006) talking about how the data has been used post term, but haven't yet seen anything about during term at an organisational level.
