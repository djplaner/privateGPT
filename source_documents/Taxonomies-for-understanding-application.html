<p><a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/">The group</a> I work with is charged with helping <a href="http://www.cquni.edu.au/">CQUniversity</a> staff make use of various innovations around educational technology. One of the difficulties if giving staff a taste of the breadth of possibilities for what a new technology might be able to do.

One tool for doing that is a taxonomy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework">conceptual framework</a> or a theory for analysis and description (<a href="http://www.ise.canberra.edu.au/un6797/Shirley/No6-MISQ%20RA%203828%20theory%20sub%205%20260705%20final-f.pdf">Gregor 2006</a>). These essentially attempt to generate some sort of classification or mapping of a topic area into a number of distinct (and hopefully useful) components/categories.

Some examples related to our need around educational technology include (though not necessarily strictly speaking a taxonomy/framework)

<h3>What makes a good descriptive theory</h3>

<a href="http://www.ise.canberra.edu.au/un6797/Shirley/No6-MISQ%20RA%203828%20theory%20sub%205%20260705%20final-f.pdf">Gregor 2006</a> offers the following suggestions about a good/useful descriptive theory
<ul>
  <li> little is known about some phenomena, </li>
  <li> descriptions should correspond as far as possible to “what is”, </li>
  <li> the classification system is useful in aiding analysis in some way,  </li>
  <li> the category labels and groupings are meaningful and natural, </li>
  <li> the hierarchies of classification are appropriate, </li>
  <li> the logic for placement of phenomena into categories should be clear, </li>
  <li> the logic for the characteristics that define each category should be clear, </li>
  <li> the classification system should be complete and exhaustive. </li>
</ul>

<h3>A suggestion - the 7 principles</h3>

CQUniversity has adopted the 7 Principles of Good Practice in Education by Chickering and Gamson (<a href="http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/7princip.htm">1987</a>) as important to its learning and teaching.  One obvious suggestion would be to use those as part of a taxonomy.  Especially if the 7 Principles is widely used elsewhere at CQUniversity.  It should theoretically become more useful and more clear to our staff if we use this in many places.

The 7 principles, by themselves, may not be sufficient. Perhaps we need to think of supplementing it with other dimensions.  Some options here might include Tony Bates' <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/materials/review/2005/Bates_review.htm">ACTION model</a>.  Though I wonder if that might be starting to get too overwhelming.

Obviously time to be looking at some literature.</p>
