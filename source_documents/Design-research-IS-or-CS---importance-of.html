<p>Tags: design theory, Uncategorized</p>

<p>The Information Systems discipline has had lots of talk about design science research (aka many other related terms).

Much of it appears to be promoted by (described in the worst possible light) as refugees from engineering and computer science wanting to do what they used to do.

Personally, I have some issues around what is classed as design science research within Information Systems and what belongs to Computer Science.  i.e. I think a lot DSR in IS should be classed as computer science.

This isn't to say it isn't valid research.  It is to say that I don't think it is valid research within the IS discipline.

I've been looking for some references that mention the importance of "no overlap" in research, theory etc.

Sheth, Bardner &amp; Garret (1998), "Marketing theory: Evaluation and evolution" might be just such a thing.  Wiley, 1988</p>
