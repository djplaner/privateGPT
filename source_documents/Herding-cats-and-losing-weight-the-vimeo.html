<p><p>This is in part a test of Wordpress.com's new support for <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> video.  The video below is of a presentation I gave at CQU this year.  The abstract is below. The slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/herding-cats-and-losing-weighthow-to-improve-learning-and-teaching?src=embed">on slideshare</a>.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The environment within which Universities operate has changed significantly over recent years. Two of the biggest changes have been a reduction in state funding for universities and, at the same time, an increased need for universities to demonstrate the quality and appropriateness of their services, especially learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Consequently, most universities have developed a range of strategies, policies, structures and systems with the intent of improving and demonstrating the quality of their learning and teaching. This presentation will draw on the metaphors of herding cats and losing weight to examine the underlying assumptions of these attempts, the resulting outcomes, question whether or not they are the best we can hope for, and present some alternatives.</p>
