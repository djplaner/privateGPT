Late last year I <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/12/28/update-on-the-website-move-google-rankings/">wrote</a> that this blog was currently ranked #12 by Google (US-based search) for a search on "david jones".
</p>
<p>
Over the Xmas break I spent a fair bit of time copying content from my old website to this blog and putting in place permanent redirects from the old site to the new content.  I also uploaded some images onto my Flickr photos and included links to content on the blog that was associated.
</p>
<p>
Today, when I do the same search the blog is now ranked #5 by Google for a US-based search.
</p>
<p>
For an Australian based Google search the site is up from 177 to 87
