<p>The following is step 2 in getting organised for a trial of <a href="http://voicethread.com/">VoiceThread</a> as part of the <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni">PLEs@CQUni project</a>. The background was given in a <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=197">previous post</a>.

This post tries to summarise what's been found about create a presentation in Voice Thread.  It's more a work in progress and a way of saving what I'm finding, rather than any particular use for anyone else.

It appears that a presentation (i.e. like Powerpoint) might be one approach to support the development of an online research poster. Much of this information is taken from the <a href="http://voicethread.com/#c28">VoiceThread Tutorials</a> example on <a href="http://voicethread.com/#c28.b23349.i137777">VoiceThread Presentations</a>.

The example is a nice example, includes the talking head and some doodling.

It's that hard a process, apparently includes the following steps
<ul>
   <li>  Create the presentation file.<br />
VoiceThread suggest that the presentation file should be PDF and 1024x768 or larger with a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Powerpoint, at least on the Mac, has it as an export option.
  </li>
  <li> Upload it to Slideshare. <br />
         This seems a fairly simple process, need to set the options.  The <a href="http://voicethread.com/#c28.b8381.i61448">1 minute VoiceThread</a> tutorial gives a good introduction.
  </li>
  <li> Set some options - collaboration <br />
         Has the ability to invite people, make it public, moderate comments and include the voice thread in public list.  Will need to include this in a screen cast.
  <li> Record the narration. <br />
         Using voice thread's 5 methods of recording.
  </li>
</ul>

Comments on VoiceThreads appear to require that you have a VoiceThread account.  This will be a bit of a limitation when it comes to having visitors to the research poster session comment on the posters.

Interesting that <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> does offer a "guest comment" facility that requires you are able to read a captcha, rather than login.</p>
