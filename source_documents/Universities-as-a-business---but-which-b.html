<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p>Last week I gave a presentation to new academic staff at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a>, a part of their "induction" process. The presentation was titled <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Presentations/PossibleFutures/">Some possible futures of e-learning: Lessons and enablers</a>.

The basic premise was something along the lines
<ul>
  <li> Current e-learning practice is far from good. </li>
  <li> Future e-learning practice will look nothing like it. </li>
  <li> What are some the contextual factors, the lessons and the enablers that might guide the creation of that future practice? </li>
</ul>

One of the lessons I proposed was that the idea of the  "University as a business" was a bit limited.

<h3>University as a business</h3>

The literature in and around higher education has, for at least 20 years, included a large percentage of discussion that universities should be run as businesses.  Actually, I'm pretty sure I've seen references that this has been a complain, typically from business and politicians for a lot long than that.

This following quote summarises much of the current rationale behind that idea (Dodd, 2004)
<blockquote>
Declining revenues and public support … coupled with increased competition, performance requirements, constituent accountability, globalization and changing political climates. All of this has forced a new reality for higher education … one that requires greater efficiency, effectiveness and business-like processes.
</blockquote>

So if we adopt business-like processes then universities will be better value for money and all will be right with the world.

The main problem I have with this is that not all businesses are the same.  Which type of business should a university borrow its practices from?

<h3>Types of businesses</h3>

I don't believe it is possible to treat all businesses the same.  The strategies and tactics required to run IBM are different from those to run a supermarket chain, a local corner store or a professional sports team.

I also don't believe that each business or organisation is so unique that it needs to be entirely individually catered for.  I think/hope that there is a useful middle road. McKelvey &amp; Aldrich (1983) seem to agree, at least the quote in Rich (1992) indicates this
<blockquote>
Classifying organizations into types presents an alternative to the idea that organizations are either all alike or are all individually unique.
</blockquote>

<h3>University as a professional service firm</h3>

An ex-Harvard Business School professor, <a href="http://davidmaister.com/">David Maister</a> has made a name through working with professional service firms and is the author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684834316/qid=1153181013/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;tag2=davidmaisterc-20">Managing the Professional Service Firm</a>.  His description, from this book, of the professional service firm has, for me, striking similarities with universities.

<blockquote>
Two aspects…create the special management challenges of the professional service firm. First… a high degree of customization in their work … Second, … strong component of face-to-face interaction with the client
</blockquote>

Straight after this description comes the quote which strikes at the heart of the current "efficiency" emphasis in university management.
<blockquote>
Management principles and approaches from the industrial or mass-consumer sectors, based..on standardization, supervision, and marketing of repetitive tasks..are not only inapplicable…but may be dangerously wrong.
</blockquote>

What does that say about the adoption of such practices as quality assurance and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems by universities?

The Oxford Said Business School has an <a href="http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ccc/Professional+Service+Firm.htm">article online</a> about professional service firms.
