<a href="http://globalconnectionusq.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/minute-paper/">Andrew's main worry</a> is indicative of one of my concerns with both courses I'm currently teaching. Both courses throw the participants in at the deep-end with a few new (to almost all) technologies that the courses draw heavily on. There is varying levels of scaffolding to help, but it stops well short of being involving very detailed and specific instructions.

There are a few reasons for that, including
<ol> <li> The importance to both courses of students developing the skills to solve their own technical problems.  </li>
  <li> The desire for students to explore the specific technologies that suit them and not be limited to what I recommend. </li> </ol>

But learning "how to fish" in this context is not a easy process. Which is both another plus, but also a minus.

So if you are (or have been) a student in EDC3100 or EDU8117, let me know what you think. How did the approach work (or not) for you?

I wonder if there's anyone doing this well that I can gain some insights into how to do it better. Perhaps that something to add to my list of tasks around participating in NGL/EDU8117.</p>
