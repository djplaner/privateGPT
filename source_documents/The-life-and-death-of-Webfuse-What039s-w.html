<p>The following is a collection of presentation resources (i.e. the slides) for an ASCILITE'2012 of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/the-life-and-death-of-webfuse-principles-for-learning-and-leading-into-the-future/">this paper</a>. The paper and presentation are a summary of the outcomes my PhD work. The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">thesis</a> goes into much more detail.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Drawing on the 14-year life and death of an integrated online learning environment used by tens of thousands of people, this paper argues that many of the principles and practices underpinning industrial e-learning – the current dominant institutional model – are inappropriate. The paper illustrates how industrial e-learning can limit outcomes of tertiary e-learning and limits the abilities of universities to respond to uncertainty and effectively explore the future of learning. It limits their ability to learn. The paper proposes one alternate set of successfully implemented principles and practices as being more appropriate for institutions seeking to learn for the future and lead in a climate of change.

<h3>Slides</h3>
