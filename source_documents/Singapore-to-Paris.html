After much shopping (mostly winter clothes - much needed and used already) and a bit of time in the QClub - time to get back on a plane for the 13+ hours to London. The upgrade to Business didn't come through but the nice check in lady from Brisbane had put us in the next best thing.  A row of seats behind a partition that meant we had enough room to our legs out straight.  Very nice. Both Sandy and I slept a reasonable amount for this type of thing.  Watched a number of movies and basically waited for the flight to be over.
</p>
<p>
The highlight for me as about halfway into the flight when we were over the middle East somewhere.  Having a window seat I looked out to see clouds below shining in a full moon.  Just above and to the left of our plane were two contrails from other planes.  One of which I could see their navigation flights flashing in the distance.  The moon was shining on these and making them glow. Very nice.  Pity the camera was lodged up above and the scene only lasted for a few minutes.
<p>
On arrival at Heathrow (Terminal 4) we had to make our way to the new Terminal 5 that has been in the news for last bags (thankfully ours made it through no worries). However, we did have a long walk through various cold and draft passage ways to get to the bus for Terminal 5.  What followed was a good 15 minutes on the crowded bus. The time taken did generate some negative comments from the locals.
</p>
<p>
Once inside Terminal 5 things went okay. Very noticeable that it is a new terminal. The security process is fairly quick and well though out, however, it is somewhat different from previous experience (e.g. you don't take your computer out of the bag for screening) and the novelty seems to slow folk down. At this point I could also make disparaging comments about whinging Poms who did not seem happy with the process, but I am now more culturally aware and realise that this sort of generalisation is fraught with weakness.  Of course, all the way through this process there were signs along the lines "Don't talk nasty to us as it won't help you get through any quicker you whinging pom".
</p>
<p>
Inside the terminal there were lots of nice shiny and large duty free stores including some with very nice deals on alcohol. However, we didn't have time to partake as by the time we visited the facilities we were being called to our gate. A gate that happened to be down stairs and out of the way. The size, location and lighting did not bode well.
</p>
<p>
The process for getting on the plane, once the boarding pass was checked, was to go outside onto another bus (remember this is a winters morning in London - 1 degree and wet - though not raining).  After a 10 minute drive we're back outside climbing up into a Airbus 319 that is parked with others away from the terminal. Thank god it wasn't raining. At this stage it was then another 20 minutes before we started moving, another 20 minutes taxing before a 40 minute flight to Paris.
</p>
<p>
The flight went well in Paris quickly.  A reverse of the Heathrow experience in terms of bus and terminal.  Pick up a bottle of 12yo Scotch and pass through customs - quick look at the passport and through.
</p>
<p>
Now came the big test.  Would our bags have made it through Terminal 5 and all subsequent change overs.  It wasn't looking good, waiting, waiting.  One of the baggage service folk came over for a talk, but no, we're not the ones they were after.  A few of our other colleagues from the flight were milling around looking worried.  Just as it was looking bad, out comes our bag.  There's a win.  Things might be looking up.
</p>
<p>
Next to go through security.  Four stations either side of an open hall.  No line, people walking through. Do we walk through?  Why not.  Yep, all the way through, no checks.
</p>
<p>
Now comes the task of ringing our landlady.  First set of phones would not work. Credit card, coins (had to get change for Euro coins) and phone card did not work. Bugger. This might not work well.
</p>
<p>
Move onto another set of phones.  Ahh, this one takes coins.  Put 1.40 euro in the phone, make the call and wallah - talking to Mme Rivaud. Organise to meet her out front of the apartment building in an hour - but the phone cuts out before we could say goodbye.  Lets up she doesn't take this the wrong way.  The funny thing is, the phone gave me back 40 euro cents.  It only like the $1 euro.
</p>
<p>
Outside for a taxi and a hope that the written directions will be sufficient for him to get us there.  A 40 minute drive and we're deposited outside the apartment. At which we have to wait for 10 minutes or so for the landlady to turn up

<p>
Not all that bad, get a chance to walk around the neighbourhood, but it is cold. Sandy's putting her "cold" boots on when the landlady arrives.  Shows us the ropes, helps us settle in and then were alone in our little French apartment for the next 7 days.
