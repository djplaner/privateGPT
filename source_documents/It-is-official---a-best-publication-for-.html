<p>I don't like to brag, but you don't get this sort of thing all that often.

Last week I was in Paris for the <a href="http://www.icis2008.org/">ICIS'2008 conference</a>. The main reason for going to the conference was to receive an award.

It turns out that the <a href="http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol8/iss5/1/">The Anatomy of a Design Theory</a> by <a href="http://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/staff/info.asp?Surname=Gregor&amp;Firstname=Shirley">Professor Shirley Gregor</a> and myself has been voted as one of the 5 best publications within the Information Systems discipline by a group of senior scholars.

That goes with being the paper of 2007 for the <a href="http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/">Journal of the Association for Information Systems</a>.

Thanks Shirley.

I was going to include a photo the little plaque we each received but that was perhaps taking things a bit too far.</p>
