<p>Tags: Uncategorized, webfuse</p>

<p>George Siemens has a <a href="http://www.icwe.net/oeb_special/downloads/siemens/online_educa/player.html">online presentation</a> intended to introduce key concepts for a <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002636.html">presentation</a> he is giving at <a href="http://www.online-educa.com/">Online Educa</a>.

The second slide attempts to characterise today's knowledge climate.  For me, each of these characteristics resonate with the ideas behind Webfuse and why a "LMS" implementation makes better sense implemented ateleologically, rather than teleologically.

The characteristics are
<ul>
  <li> Continual suspended certainty </li>
  <li> Connected specialisation </li>
  <li> Complexity and co-creation </li>
  <li> Continual </li>
  <li> Chaotic </li>
</ul>

Slide 5 is a nice representation of how life needs to stop for learning and how it no longer represents the current reality.

Slide 7 talks about the problem with plan-driven approaches and its limitations.</p>
