<p>One of the other participants shared her current position with <a href="http://netgl.wordpress.com/">NGL</a>
<blockquote>I've also found it a bit tricky to get my head around all the components I need to cover off on in my blogs for assignment 1, as there seems to be a lot of different pieces we need to address. Hoping this will become a bit clearer to me as I go along. </blockquote>

In an attempt to help I've outlined below the basic process I've used in fits and starts. The reason why I haven't done more of the follow process links more to factors external to the course and the process. But I haven't engaged as much in this process as I'd have liked. Also, this is a process that works for me and where I'm at right now. It may not work for anyone else. So take the following with a grain of salt and as one example and certainly not as an exemplar or the "one way" to do it. In the end it’s important that you develop an approach that works for you.

I’m thinking I might share this more broadly as I think it might help the odd other person.

<h3>Seek</h3>

First, have a PKM process that centres around Feedly as my main “seeking” mechanism.  All the feeds etc go there supplemented by the weekly pages linked from the study schedule. Perhaps the biggest tool/seeking mechanism that sits outside of Feedly is twitter. A great source of unexpected connections.

<h3>Sense</h3>

Second, whenever I’m doing or reading anything about the course or NGL in general I should consider it from three perspectives
<ol>
  <li> As learner – I.e. How does this connect with what I’m doing around learning World of Warcraft? How can this help me understand what I’ve experienced? How can it help me make plans for changes to how I participate?</li>
  <li> As teacher – same questions almost but connected to my thinking about how I’ll evolve both courses I teach (this one and EDC3100).</li>
  <li> As student – focused more on how I’m thinking about and engaging with the course readings, the blog posts of others and the resources shared via Diigo. How does the experience of using my PKM process compare with other approaches to learning? How does it fit (or not) with how I like to learn? What can I do to change and improve my learning in this course? Etc.</li>
</ol>

For me, an important part of the “sense” phase is to write summary blogs of any readings. For example, <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2014/07/29/some-readings-on-networked-learning/">this one</a>. These are meant not to only give a summary of the reading, but also to record my initial reactions to the paper and what linkages I think might exist with what I’m thinking about as learner, teacher and student. This does take longer than simply reading an article, but it does encourage me to read and consider the article more deeply (something I need) and it also provides a record of my thoughts that I can come back to at a later date.

<h3>Share</h3>

As part of the sense process I’d be writing it all down in blog posts.  Not just thinking about it.  In some cases what I do is start a blog post and just jot down rough ideas and links to what sparked those ideas. So that later I can come back and fill them out.

In other cases I write them straight out.  The idea is not that these are polished, complete formal bits of academic writing.  They are quick mind dumps an example of working through ideas and thoughts. Often with fairly significant flaws and unfinished thinking.  The point is to get the thinking down, because I find that writing about it helps.  More importantly making my thinking publish has often led to an unexpected bit of learning as someone makes a point or connection about what I’ve written.

Importantly, I need to make sure that as I’m writing these posts I’m making explicit connections with both what other participants have written and also with various readings, both those set from each week and also others that I find and follow up with because they link with what I need to discover/understand about me as learner, teacher and student.

As part of the above process I also come across resources etc as I follow various leads. Some of these I’ll share via Diigo</p>
