<p>Tags: bad, netgl</p>

<p>I've been set a task (asked nicely really) by my Head of School if it is possible to produce a map that will allow all and sundry to see the geographic spread of our students.

I vaguely remember doing something like this previously with Google maps, but I didn't think it "visual" enough.  @palbion identified a couple of GIS experts in another school who could probably do it.  I still don't know whether I can do it, but I'm using this as an opportunity to test the adage from Connectivism that<blockquote>The capacity to know is more critical than what is actually known (Siemens, 2008)</blockquote>

Can I use my "capacity to know" to solve this problem?

<h3>Making a connection</h3>

Just over an hour ago I tweeted out a plea

Within minutes @katemfd tweeted and introduced me to "the Fresh Prince of Visualisation of Things on Maps"

Who replied very quickly with this advice

<h3>Making many more connections</h3>

Now all I have to do is to grok <a href="https://cartodb.com/">@cartodb</a> and produce a map.

But first, perhaps check <a href="https://cartodb.com/pricing/">pricing and functionality</a>.  Looks like the free version will work.  The small wrinkle is the absence of "private datasets".  In the last week we've had a couple of serious emails make the rounds about student privacy.  Will have to keep that in mind.

I should filter the data a bit more, but let's give it a go.
<ol>
  <li> Drag and drop data onto the page </li>
  <li> Nice interface to manipulate the data once uploaded. </li>
  <li> First problem is geo-referencing the data.
       Postcodes are in the data, but not sure if this is sufficient.  Need to look at the support.  Looks like I might need to add country details. That's it. </li>
</ol>

First version done.  Time to filter.  At this stage, I'm not going to show the visualisations given the worry about privacy.

Oh nice, the platform automatically creates different visualisations including a heat map and has wizards to modify further.

That's produced a reasonable first go.  Will need to refine it more, but enough to send off to the HoS.

That took no more than 20 minutes.

<h3>So which is  more important?</h3>

The original quote is<blockquote>The capacity to know is more critical than what is actually known</blockquote>

The above experience is actually a combination of both. The network I've built on Twitter - especially the brilliant @katemfd (performing as what Barabasi would call a network hub) - has provided the "capacity to know". It helped me access someone for whom @cartodb was "actually known".

But wouldn't Google have worked just as well?

A couple of weeks ago I had performed a quick Google search and didn't find @cartodb. I didn't "actually know" about it and so I had to spend too much time figuring out how "to know".

But even making the connection with @cbhorley wasn't sufficient. In order to use @cartodb effectively I used a range of stuff that I already "know".</p>
