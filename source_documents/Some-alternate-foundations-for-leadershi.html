<p>On Monday the 25th of August I am meant to be giving a talk that attempts to link complexity theory (and related topics) to the practice of leadership of learning and teaching within a university setting.  The talk is part of a broader seminar series occurring this year at <a href="http://www.cquniversity.edu.au/">CQUniversity</a> as part of the institution's <a href="http://learning.cqu.edu.au/staff_development/presentations/lt_seminars-presentations.htm">learning and teaching seminars</a>. The leadership in L&amp;T series is being pushed/encouraged by <a href="http://fseh.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/staff.do?site=100&amp;sid=REABURNP">Dr Peter Reaburn</a>.

This, and perhaps a couple of other blogs posts, is meant to be a part of a small experiment in the use of social software.  The abstract of the talk that goes out to CQUniversity staff will mention this blog post and some <a href="http://delicious.com/davidj1/complexityleadership">related del.icio.us bookmarks</a>.  I actually don't expect it to work all that well as I don't have the energy to do the necessary preparations.

Enough guff, what follows is the current abstract that will get sent out.

Some alternate foundations for leadership in L&amp;T at CQUniversity

<h3>
  Abstract
</h3>

Over recent years an increasing interest in improving the quality of university learning and teaching has driven a number of projects such as the <a href="http://www.altc.edu.au/carrick/go">ALTC</a>, <a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/learning_teaching/ltpf/">LTPF</a>  and <a href="http://www.auqa.edu.au/">AUQA</a>. One of the more recent areas of interest has been the question of learning and teaching leaders. In 2006 and 2007 ALTC funded 20 projects worth about $3.4M around leadership in learning and teaching. Locally, there has been a series of CQUniversity L&amp;T seminars focusing on the question of leadership in L&amp;T.

This presentation arises from a long-term sense of disquiet about the foundations of much of this work, an on-going attempt to identify the source of this disquiet and find alternate, hopefully better, foundations. The presentation will attempt to illustrate the disquiet and explain how insights from a number of sources (see some references below) might help provide alternate foundations. It will briefly discuss the implications these alternate foundations may have for the practice of L&amp;T at CQUniversity.

This presentation is very much a work in progress and is aimed at generating an on-going discussion about this topic and its application at CQUniversity. Some parts of that discussion and gathering of related resources is already occuring online at
