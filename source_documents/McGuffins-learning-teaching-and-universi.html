<p><p>D'Arcy Norman suggests that <a href="http://www.darcynorman.net/2010/07/02/edupunk-is-a-mcguffin/">Edupunk is a McGuffin</a>. I like the metaphor.  But I think it breaks down a bit, at least in the context I'm interested in.</p>
<p>Wikipedia uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">definition of a McGuffin</a> that suggests it is "a plot element that catches the viewers' attention or drives the plot of a work of fiction".  Wikipedia suggests that the defining characteristic of a McGuffin is<blockquote>the major players in the story are (at least initially) willing to do and sacrifice almost anything to obtain it, regardless of what the MacGuffin actually is.</blockquote>.</p>
<p>Importantly, as Wikipedia suggests<blockquote>the specific nature of the MacGuffin may be ambiguous, undefined, generic, left open to interpretation or otherwise completely unimportant to the plot.</blockquote> What is important is not the details or nature of edupunk, top-down quality assurance, problem-based learning, teacher-of-the year awards, or anything else. What is important is what happens as a result of the characters wanting to obtain the McGuffin. In movies, what's important is a good plot.</p>
<p>I work in a university context. In that context, I think what's important is improving the quality of learning and teaching. I don't see enough of that happening. To a large extent I think this is due to the absence of appropriate McGuffins. The current McGuffins within a university context aren't driving the majority of academics to improve the quality of learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Edupunk is the right McGuffin for some. But I'm not sure how widespread that is. The folk interested in Edupunk are generally not the ones that need a McGuffin.</p>
<p>So, what is the McGuffin for improving L&amp;T within a university? Does it make sense for there to be one, or even a small number of McGuffins?</p>
