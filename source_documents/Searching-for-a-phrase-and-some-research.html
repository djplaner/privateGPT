<p>Tags: elearning</p>

<p>This is a plea for help.  I'm certain I remember a particular phrase/concept that arose from some research around educational technology from 10+ years ago (may have been as long as 30 years ago).

It was a phrase/concept that was used to look critically at the tendency for education to create special education versions of real software.  i.e. rather than use a standard bit of software - e.g. Word (*shudder*) - they would have to use a word processor made specially for education (K12 mostly I believe).

Does this ring any bells for you? Can you point me in a useful direction?

Thanks.</p>
