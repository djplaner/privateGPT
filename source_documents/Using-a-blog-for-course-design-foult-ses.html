<p><p>I've bitten the bullet and have decided to use <a href="http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/">Wordpress blog</a> to support the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/01/28/the-design-of-a-6-hour-orientation-to-course-analysis-and-design/">6 hour orientation to course analysis and design</a> I'm supposed to run next week.</p>
<p>It's probably going to be much more work than I should or planned to put in, but so far it's been fairly easy. It may be worthwhile.</p></p>
