<p>Tags: Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites</p>

<p>Thanks to a bit of "synergy" it looks like CQU might be getting its first Web 2.0 course site.  I'm currently defining a Web 2.0 course site as a recognisable course website that just happens to be implemented, to a significant extent, making use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2">"Web 2.0"</a> services.

The label is a contradiction in terms.  Web 2.0 is not about client/server, a single site that hosts all the material.  It's about a bunch of services being mixed together in an ad hoc way by the participants (and that's not a definition I plan reusing too often). I'm reasonably sure that folk like <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> would have some very valid qualms about the concept.

I think there's value in the idea as a stage in development.  A small step along the road to Web 2.0 goodness that is familiar enough to academic staff to overcome the fear of all the Web 2.0 novelty.  I've argued briefly about this <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=66">before</a>.

It fits with my attachment to Roger's diffusion of innovation theories.  A Web 2.0 course site is a method to show the Web 2.0 "stuff" in a form that is
<ul>
  <li> compatible with existing practice;
   There is still a course site like most already have.
  </li>
  <li> provides relative advantage;
The web 2.0 technologies are easier to use and provide some more useful features than a traditional LMS.
  </li>
  <li> at the cost of little complexity; </li>
  <li> while be something that is observable (because a Web 2.0 course site would essentially be open) </li>
</ul>

<h3>What we'll be doing</h3>

By July 9 the site should be up.  It will be for the course <a href="http://handbook.cqu.edu.au/course.jsp?courseid=26185">EDED11448, Creative Futuring</a> being taught by <a href="http://fahe.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/staff.do?site=3&amp;sid=WALKERBM">Bernie Walker-Gibbs</a>.  The work is also part of CQU Learning &amp; Teaching grant Bernie received this year to look at this sort of stuff.

The rough initial plan is for the course site to have the following sections
<ul>
  <li> Resources<br />
         A list of resources the staff and students find relevant to the course and which they tag using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> and which will be displayed on this page.  This will include a course podcast pointing to various interesting podcast episodes already out on the net - again using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> and at the moment this <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2005/07/11">approach</a> using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>
  </li>
  <li> Weblog and Portfolio<br />
         Each student will maintain a journal and a portfolio using <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/">RedBubble</a>.
  </li>
  <li> Learning Space<br />
         The course material will be hosted here on <a href="http://www.wetpaint.com/">WetPaint</a> (a Wiki).  WetPaint supports <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> which allows us to learn some lessons in that area.
  </li>
  <li> Announcements<br />
         Most likely implemented as a blog using <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> or similar.
  </li>
</ul>

There may also be a <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Papers_and_Books/Barometer_Lessons/">course barometer</a> - which isn't (yet) very Web 2.0.

<h3>What will it achieve</h3>

At the least we will learn some lessons about what is involved, what works and what doesn't.  It help inform us around what I (and some others) think is the next step in "course sites".</p>
