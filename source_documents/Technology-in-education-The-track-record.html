<p>The following bit of pseudo-code is from van Dam (1999) and strongly matches my experience with educational technology, especially within universities.

<code>for each new technology
{
  &nbsp;&nbsp; euphoria and hype

  &nbsp;&nbsp;  struggle to produce material for the new medium

  &nbsp;&nbsp;  mature judgement

  &nbsp;&nbsp;  disappointment and cynicism

  &nbsp;&nbsp;  wait for the next technology that will be the answer
}</code>

Though I must admit that I'm finding it harder not to immediately jump to <code>disappointment and cynicism</code>.

And the author - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_van_Dam">Andries van Dam</a> - has a bit of history with educational technology.  Though the <code>struggle to produce material for the new medium</code> step does seem to suggest a certain type of perspective of education/teaching.

<h3>Update</h3>

And don't forget <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/06/birnbaums-fad-cycle-in-higher-education/">Birnbaum's fad life-cycle</a> and the Gartner Hype Cycle.
