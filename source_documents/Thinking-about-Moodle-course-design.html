<p>Tags: edc3100, teaching</p>

<p>Over the next couple of weeks I am going to be responsible for the design of a Moodle course site. This will be the first time in almost 5 years that I've been the academic responsible for a course site, the first time in Moodle and in fact the first time in an "LMS" I didn't design. Add to this my on-going feelings of discomfort about the affordances of Moodle's course structure (scroll of death etc.) and the observation of some truly ugly Moodle course sites and I feel the need to be further informed.

The following is a collection of sites and resources I've gathered to inform my design of the course site. What have I missed? What are the really good resources for Moodle course design?

<h3>Basics</h3>

<ul>
  <li> A very <a href="http://www.markdrechsler.com/?p=745">recent effort</a> from Mark Drechsler that gives a introduction to the basics concepts of Moodle course design. </li>
  <li> Some <a href="http://medusa.ballarat.edu.au/lews/drupal/staff/moodle/howto/layout">material</a> from the University of Ballarat (which I've referenced previously), very basic background. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Avoiding the scroll of death</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtHPUh_BaxM">Video</a> showing how to "Make your Moodle course page look like a webpage".<br />This feels like the "workaround" solution to me. It's a case of using the linking capability of the web and some unexpected aspects of Moodle (if you reduce # of topics to 1, the other topics remain but aren't visible) to workaround Moodle's actual supposed structure.<p>I believe this "working around" bites you in the rear-end when you go to copy the course for the next offering. The "workaround" links tend to point back to the resources/activities from the last offering, not the current, which leads to all sorts of confusion.<p>Another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiCgf7rAdJc">video</a> that uses the same "unexpected aspect" for something a little different.</p> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.moodlenews.com/2012/super-simple-navigation-with-a-little-html-and-the-topics-format/">Description and video</a> of a similar, but slightly different approach to improving navigation. </li>
  <li> The <a href="http://www.moodlenews.com/2010/collapsed-topics-eliminates-the-scroll-of-death-in-moodle/">collapsed topics course format</a> is somewhat related and as it happens is installed at USQ. </li>
  <li> A <a href="http://opensource.com/education/12/1/designing-aesthetically-pleasing-moodle-courses">blog post</a> that combines a bit of design 101 with four Moodle design strategies. </li>
  <li> A <a href="http://moodleman.moodle.com.au/archives/47">blog post</a> showing some of the alternate course formats. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<ul>
  <li> A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michelledmoore/teaching-with-moodle-best-practices-for-course-design-i-moot-11">presentation</a> on best practices for course design. <br />
        The principles include:
         <ul>
            <li> Don't use more than 3 font styles per page. </li>
            <li> Maintain consistency. </li>
            <li> Don't use the course page for content. </li>
            <li> Do use the course page as a launchpad. </li>
            <li> Don't be the one doing all the work (I didn't get this one). </li>
            <li> Do let the students participate and collaborate.<br />Ahh, the problem with the previous point is a site that contains only content and no ability for students to do something on the site. </li>
            <li> Don't make folk scroll side to side. </li>
            <li> Make sure the content fits. </li>
            <li> Don't forget about the value of logs?? </li>
            <li> Don't over do the activity names, keep them short and sweet. </li>
            <li> Use labels to guide students. </li>
            <li> Don't be afraid of white space. </li>
            <li> Use topic summaries for titles. </li>
            <li> Don't force users to scroll and scroll and.. </li>
            <li> Use images to enhance your course. </li>
            <li> Simplify delivery. </li>
            <li> Don't be afraid to branch out??? </li>
            <li> Give your learner's completion tracking. (a Moodle 2 feature I believe)<br /> i.e. turn on a Moodle feature for them to "tick off" what they've done. </li>
            <li> Don't overdo the conditional activities.<br />I think the <a href="http://sarahthorneycroft.com/blog/2011/08/02/the-moodle-dailies-a-guided-tour/">Moodle dailies</a> breaks this one. </li>
         </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Up a level</h3>

The following resources take a step back and connect the low-level task of layout the Moodle course site with the broader task of designing the course.
<ul>
  <li> Joyce Seitzinger's <a href="http://www.cats-pyjamas.net/2011/07/moodle-course-design-a-high-wire-act-mootnz11/">Moodle course design: a high-wire act presentation </a> from Moot'NZ.<br />Gives a good "best practice" overview of how an institutional environment/process should work with academics working with learning designers (use appropriate word).  <p>Does have links to some useful resources. Especially the very useful <a href="http://www.cats-pyjamas.net/2010/05/moodle-tool-guide-for-teachers/">Moodle tool guide</a>. </p> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/869/1575">Article</a> in the IRRODL journal title "Universal instructional design principles for Moodle". </li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Also from this week is <a href="http://www.moodlenews.com/2012/want-to-see-some-cool-course-design-checkout-the-moodle-at-university-of-sussex/">an article</a> describing some "cool course design" from the University of Sussex.<br />Seems to break the blocks and scroll of death model. Includes pointers to example sites you can login as guest.<p>It appears that this is achieved through a new course format called <a href="http://www.moodlenews.com/2011/the-pages-course-format-will-blow-you-away/">pages</a>. Which I believe means that the local Moodle admins would have to install the course format into Moodle before it would be available. Apparently Moodle 2.3 will have this.</p> </li>
  <li> The <a href="http://sarahthorneycroft.com/blog/2011/08/02/the-moodle-dailies-a-guided-tour/">Moodle dailies</a>. </li>
  <li> A <a href="https://moodle.drew.edu/course/category.php?id=25">Moodle instance</a> that lets you see three different course formats (social, topics, and weekly) in Moodle. </li>
</ul></p>
