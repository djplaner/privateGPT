<p>Tags: bim, bim2, Uncategorized</p>

<p>The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/12/19/first-coding-steps-for-bim2/">last post</a> covered the initial steps in starting bim2.  Including the choice of the name <em>bim2</em>.  But there is a problem.

<h3>The problem</h3>

It's starting to look like the choice of <em>bim2</em> as a name might not have been great. It appears Moodle may not like a digit in the name of a module.  <a href="When creating a new module, the new name of the module must not contain numbers or other special characters!">Confirmed</a><blockquote>When creating a new module, the new name of the module must not contain numbers or other special characters!</blockquote>

The end result is that the "Add an activity" menu in Moodle only ever shows <em>bim</em> and not <em>bim2</em> which means adding the activity won't work.

The name will have to change. At least within Moodle.

This is just a bit of a bugger. Will mean I have to change the name of the git repository and a whole lot of other mucking around.  I can't really go back to use <em>bim</em> as the repo name, as that name is already taken by the Moodle 1.9 version of bim.  I really don't like this, both the need to change and the limited knowledge of mine resulting in the need for the change.

<h3>Name change?</h3>

So, should the name be <em>bimTwo</em>? It's probably the best compromise. But still ugly. Especially since the #bim2 tag is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/moodleman/status/16317089866321921">already being used</a> and makes the most sense.

Solution? For now, I think the plan will be to use <em>bimTwo</em> internal to Moodle, but encourage and use bim2 elsewhere.   Maybe <em>bim_two</em> instead?

What do you think? Is there a better solution?

Actually, it will have to be <em>bimtwo</em> due
<ul>
  <li> underscore being a special character and not working within a Moodle module name; </li>
  <li> uppercase characters don't work/aren't supported in table names in the Moodle database. </li>
</ul></p>
