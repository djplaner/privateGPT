<p>Tags: bam, Uncategorized</p>

<p><a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/">blogs for learning</a> is an "online resource about instructional blogging</a> being set up by Michigan State University.  I've volunteered/been asked to write an article about the use of blogs in <a href="http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/">COIS20025</a> and <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Projects/BAM/">BAM</a>.

This post where I'm going to start my writing.

<strong>Thinking about the article</strong>

Would be nice to link in with some of the <a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/articles/">previous articles</a> on the site.  Here's a summary of articles I might link to and why
<ul>
  <li> David Parry, <a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/articles/view.php?id=6">The Technology of Reading and Writing in the Digital Space: Why RSS is crucial for a Blogging Classroom</a>.
Has some references to RSS and its use within instructional blogging. Allows me to place the rationale for BAM in the range of uses fo blogs.
  </li>
  <li> Sarah Lohnes, <a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/articles/view.php?id=7">Using Blogs in a College Classroom: What's Authenticity Got To Do With It?</a> has some interesting points about whether or not what I'm doing with students in COIS20025 is not "authentic" blogging.  I don't think it is.  But Sarah also points out this is not necessarily a bad thing, depending.
  </li>
  <li> Beth Lynne Ritter-Guth, <a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/articles/view.php?id=3">http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/articles/view.php?id=3</a> is a bit closer to what I'd write about, use of a blog in a class.  But from a different angle.  This is a positive story
  </li>
</ul>

The site also contains various other posts, some of the ones to refer to include
<ul>
  <li>  Nicole Elison's post on <a href="http://blogsforlearning.msu.edu/blog/archives/2">Non-Pseudonymous Student Blogging: Ethical and Legal Concerns</a>
The advantage of BAM is that students public blogs can be anonymous.  The identification of which student owns which blog is only visible to CQU staff.  Of course, in the absence of any specific advice students have tended to name their blogs using their student identifier. </li>
</ul>

<strong>What will I write about?</strong>

<ul>
  <li> Why and what we did </li>
  <li> How it worked out </li>
  <li> What's next </li>
</ul></p>
