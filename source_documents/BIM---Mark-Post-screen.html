<p>Tags: bim, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>This post is meant to document the (hopefully short) process of getting the Mark Post screen implemented in BIM.</p>

<h3>Required data</h3>

<p>The screen is passed the various cm-&gt;id and the id for bim_marking.  It will need to get:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Contents of bim_marking - i.e. the post to mark. </li>
  <li> Details about the student, including progress mark. </li>
  <li> Information about the other questions - mostly to implement the "ReAllocate" drop box.  <br />This can borrow from the AllocatePost screen.</li>
  <li> Information to generate the marking progress information - basically all of the student details stuff duplicated from AllocatePost. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation questions</h3>

<p>This will be implemented using a form and be very similar to the AllocatePost screen.  Should be able to borrow, reuse and re-factor most of that code.</p>
<p>So, let's try that first.  Copy the allocate method and make the changes necessary for marking (if this works, it shows the design ain't that great).</p>
<p>First change is that markingId is passed in, not user id.  That fixed, it's basically working. Now need to create the form.</p>
<p>This is essentially a modification of the allocate posts form to deal with a single post and include a HTML editor for creating the comments.</p>
<p>Some initial problems with setting the data, but that's more due to learning more about the forms processing/scripting in Moodle/PHP.  All fixed.  Just now fiddling with the proper logic in processing the form and displaying a decent message to the user.</p>

<h3>What's been done</h3>

<p>That seems to be working.  Marking is done. </p>

<h3>What's left to be done</h3>

<ul>
  <li> BAM has the ability for the marker to navigate to the next/previous question for the same student.  BIM doesn't have that yet. </li>
</ul></p>
