<p>A student of mine is reporting problems embedding a Prezi into a blog post.  Here's a quick test.

<h3>Straight from Prezi</h3>

Let's go with the straight prezi embed code

It looks something like this
[code lang="html"]
<a href="https://prezi.com/embed/8enn0a8y7qx3/?bgcolor=ffffff&#038;lock_to_path=0&#038;autoplay=0&#038;autohide_ctrls=0#">https://prezi.com/embed/8enn0a8y7qx3/?bgcolor=ffffff&#038;lock_to_path=0&#038;autoplay=0&#038;autohide_ctrls=0#</a>
[/code]

And the embeded prezi should appear below

<a href="https://prezi.com/embed/8enn0a8y7qx3/?bgcolor=ffffff&#038;lock_to_path=0&#038;autoplay=0&#038;autohide_ctrls=0#">https://prezi.com/embed/8enn0a8y7qx3/?bgcolor=ffffff&#038;lock_to_path=0&#038;autoplay=0&#038;autohide_ctrls=0#</a>

After a preview it's obvious this doesn't work.

The assumption being the that Prezi "embed code" isn't liked/supported by Wordpress.

The question being whether you can transform the Prezi "embed code" into something that is liked by Wordpress.

<h3>Transform the Prezi "embed code"</h3>

A quick Google search <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=embed+prezi+wordpress.com+blog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=mroQVZb1L4enmAW4z4HgDg">embed prezi wordpress.com blog</a> reveals <a href="https://wordprezi.appspot.com/">this service</a> that appears to transform the embed code.

Oh, but it looks like Prezi's done something that might break this transformation on Wordpress.com

[gigya src="http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="550" height="400" bgcolor="#ffffff" flashvars="prezi_id=8enn0a8y7qx3&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;autoplay=no&amp;autohide_ctrls=0" ]

Yep, that doesn't appear to work.

And the same Google search above reveals <a href="https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/how-to-embed-prezi?replies=5">this discussion</a> which describes why.</p>
