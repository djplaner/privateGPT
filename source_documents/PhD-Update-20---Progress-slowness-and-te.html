<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>It's been almost two weeks since my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/02/phd-update-19-falling-just-a-little-short/">last PhD update</a>, mainly due to two factors.  First, a lack of motivation due to some external factors and second, a decision to move back to Fridays as the release day for the summaries.  The move back to Fridays arises from a new regular discussion with my esteemed supervisor on Friday afternoons.  Releasing an update just before such a discussion seems to make sense.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p>In the last update I said I would get a draft of chapter 4 sent off and get back into the people section. </p>
<p> The draft of chapter 4 was sent off and generated some positive feedback.  This means that chapter 5 should be a fairly straight forward process.</p>
<p>In terms of the People section, I have completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/09/support-staff-continuing-with-the-people-component/">support staff section</a>; and </li>
  <li> a section on <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/09/the-chasm/">the chasm</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the time, when I have spent time on the thesis, has been on the "People, rationality and cognition" section. I've been doing a fair bit, but not too much, additional reading on this section because I see it as one of the central arguments in the thesis and one of the main problems facing the implementation of e-learning within universities today.  i.e. e-learning within universities is suffering from the over-emphasis on techno-rational approaches to learning and teaching, management and especially information technology which is not only completely inappropriate is got them caught in the past.</p>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>The set of tasks for next week include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> complete the "people, rationality and cognition" section; </li>
  <li> complete the "Lessons from people" section (which in turns complete the People component of the Ps Framework); </li>
  <li> get going on one of the two remaining components of the Ps framework: pedagogy and product. </li>
</ul></p>
