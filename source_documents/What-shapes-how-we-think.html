<p><div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>I've only listed to some of the audio of this presentation, and from that experience, watching the video is probably the advised approach.<br />
<br />
I find this interesting because of how it undermines the smug confidence of some folk who are so certain that they are objectively correct. That they are logical, objective and unbiased. It shows how the language you speak does appear to radically influence how we see the world.<br />
<br />
Which is important because how you see the world impacts, I believe, in how you act in the world.<br />
<br />
This connects with <a class="ML" href="http://amplify.com/redir_twitter_handle.php?t=@sthcrft">@sthcrft</a> <a href="http://sarahthorneycroft.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/on-edtech-and-bias/">blog post</a> from yesterday on bias.<br />
<br />
It also connects closely with my wife's PhD work - hence you can see some or the origins of my bias in this work.  My wife has examined articles from (arguably) the three most important journals in the field of Information Systems, sampled in a variety of ways. She's looked for the metaphors that these journal articles have used to describe three central concepts for the field of information systems: technology, people, organisations.<br />
<br />
And what has she found? The pre-dominant metaphor in terms of both prevalence, but also in how deeply it has been constructed, is that of the machine. Technology, people and organisations are talked about as if they were machines. Can you imagine how that might influence how people take action around these concepts, if they see them as machines.<br />
<br />
There are two other evident metaphors: organism and culture. Both are present, but significantly less so than the machine metaphor and they are not developed in as much depth.<br />
<br />
I've often wondered what a similar research activity performed on the educational technology literature would find?</p></div></div><div class=""><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a href="http://fora.tv/fora/showpost.php?p=46540" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://fora.tv/fora/showpost.php?p=46540">fora.tv</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote cite="http://fora.tv/fora/showpost.php?p=46540" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div class="TxtCntnt">o the languages we speak shape the way we think? For example, how do we think about time? The word "time" is the most frequent noun in the English language. Time is ubiquitous yet ephemeral. It forms the very fabric of our experience, and yet it is unperceivable: we cannot see, touch, or smell time. How do our minds create this fundamental aspect of experience? Do patterns in language and culture influence how we think about time?</div><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a href="http://fora.tv/fora/showpost.php?p=46540" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://fora.tv/fora/showpost.php?p=46540">Read more at fora.tv</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/byu1n">http://amplify.com/u/byu1n</a></div><br /></p>
