<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p>I've just created the new sample student blog for COIT11134.  This is the first post.  I've changed the look for the blog and removed the test post that Wordpress adds automatically.

<strong>Most important</strong>

Not sure there is a most important concept for this task.  Maybe it is just getting use to using the blog interface.

<strong>Problems
</strong>

Ignoring all the bells and whistles in the interface and just concentrating on getting something up that is useful for the students.

I also wonder if all this is going to be too difficult for the students who may not believe the benefits I'm suggesting.  Are the benefits actually there?  Guess we'll know in a few weeks time.</p>
