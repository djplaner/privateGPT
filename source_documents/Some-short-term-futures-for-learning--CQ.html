On Monday I gave a presentation titled "Some short-term futures of learning @ CQU". The aim was to provide <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a> staff with an understanding of the services and work being done by <a href="http://webclass.cqu.edu.au/">CD&amp;DU</a>.
</p>
<p>
The slides and video of the presentation are <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Presentations/shortTermFutures/">available here</a>
</p>
<p>
It uses the metaphor of developing a course as being similar to building a house or other type of building.  With this metaphor, the academic becomes the owner-builder and CD&amp;DU becomes the associated building trades. It then introduces two example of the recent CD&amp;DU work.
