<p>Tags: thesis</p>

<p>The following is a description of how I've gone about revising the <a href="https://netgl.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/week-1-me-and-networked-and-global-learning-ngl/">Week 1 material</a> for EDU8117, Networked and Global Learning.  The intent is to demonstrate how a tool can be used for something a little different.

<h3>The problem</h3>

The content for week 1 is <a href="https://netgl.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/week-1-me-and-networked-and-global-learning-ngl/">a longish web page</a>. It was created in a hurry last year and could use some re-jigging. I need to read through the material and ponder what changes to make.  The problem is how to record those thoughts in a way that allows me to focus on reading through the material initially.

If the material was in a Word (or PDF, or Google) document I would probably end up using Word's (or Acrobat's, Google doc's) annotation facility to mark up the text and add comments. But it's a web page and I'm not going to venture into the wilds of converting back and forth between HTML and other formats.

<h3>The solution</h3>

Luckily, I do use <a href="http://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a> which will allow me to annotate web page, and that's what I'm using.  I'm reading through the web page and highlighting sections and making comments on sections I think will change.  Once I'm complete, I'll open the blog post in the Wordpress editor beside another browser with the annotated version and make the changes.

<h3>The result</h3>

Here's what part of the web page looks like with the annotations.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/19494989689/in/dateposted-public/" title="Original NGL Week 1"><img alt="Original NGL Week 1" height="437" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/285/19494989689_0f0df0b761.jpg" width="500" /></a>

And the corresponding information in Diigo.  You'll be able to see that yourself if you visit <a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/djplaner/annotate">my Diigo library</a>. That link is actually to Diigo's list of all links I've tagged with "annotate".  I'll try to keep this the only one.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/19060709633/in/dateposted-public/" title="Diigo annotations on NGL Week 1"><img alt="Diigo annotations on NGL Week 1" height="347" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/334/19060709633_f38b869e20.jpg" width="500" /></a>

It has the advantage of leaving a visible record of the changes I've made.  Even after I've changed the original web page, Diigo has done a reasonable job of keeping the highlights and annotations in place.

It also provides the potential advantage of making explicit</p>
