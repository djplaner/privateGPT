<p>Tags: elearning, Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites</p>

<p>Pittard (2004) talks about the UK government's plans for e-learning (my bad description).  It includes the following

<blockquote>
It prioritises seven strategic action areas that are necessary to embed elearning
effectively across all sectors:
<ul>
  <li> leading sustainable e-learning implementation;
  </li> <li>supporting innovation in teaching and learning;
  </li> <li>developing the education workforce;
  </li> <li>unifying learner support;
  </li> <li>aligning assessment;
  </li> <li>building a better e-learning market;
  </li> <li>assuring technical and quality standards.
  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The first two, but especially the first point, provide support for the "web 2.0 course site" idea - i.e. e-learning provided through using SaaS (software as a service) to bring together existing services on the web.

Sustainable means, at least in part, affordable.

Pittard (2004), herself, my emphasis
<blockquote>
These represent the focus for central government action. However, actions, including many of those above, are <strong>necessary at all levels</strong> to ensure that the potential of ICT in education is realised. So the e-Learning Strategy in England is part of a larger policy landscape. It represents a leading voice in a dialogue about the actions required at different levels in order to realise the potential of ICT and to realise it efficiently â€“ that is, <strong>add value to the system without incurring large extra costs</strong>.
