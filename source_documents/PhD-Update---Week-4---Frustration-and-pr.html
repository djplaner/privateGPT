<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>This week is turning out to be perhaps the most frustrating, not due to lack of program, but instead due to connections between what I'm reading/writing and what I'm seeing in my local context. As per <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/13/phd-update-week-3/">last week's update</a> the aim this week was to complete sections of chapter 2 related to the Ps Framework.  The first section I targeted was "Past Experience"  and this has been the source of the frustration.</p>
<p>The more I read, synthesize and write about the history of learning and teaching in universities, especially e-learning, the more I get frustrated. Mainly due to seeing the same mistakes being made again and again.  Especially locally.</p>
<p>The frustration means I've bitten the bullet and am writing this update a bit earlier than normal.</p>

<h3>What I've done this week</h3>

<p>Here's a summary of what I said I'd do last week and what has actually happened:</p>
<ul> <li>Complete as many sections of the Ps Framework (chapter 2) as possible and have most put onto the blog.<br />
   I posted a first draft of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/18/the-ps-framework/">"introduction to the Ps framework"</a> section.  I've made some significant progress in structuring most of the 7 sections associated with components of the Ps Framework.  Most progress has been made on the "Past Experience" section.</li>
  <li> Need to complete reading the theory building paper and provide feedback.<br /> I've done nothing on this one.  Sorry Shirley.</li>
    <li>  Need to tidy up a bit of the other outstanding literature I have gathered.<br />This has been the other task I've done this week.  Trouble is that there has been a minimum of tidying and a maximum of finding more literature that needs tidying up.  That said, the new literature is good stuff and will help - but it's still frustrating (and always will be) to find new insights that help inform what you're doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of PhD related blog posts, I've done the following this week</p>
<ul>
  <li> First draft of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/18/the-ps-framework/">"introduction to the Ps framework"</a> section.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/19/technology-will-not-change-the-way-we-teach-an-example-why-were-an-amnesiac-field/">A post</a> railing against the "technology will change teaching" matra that I'm seeing all the time these days, even though past experience suggests it's no where near that simple.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/18/coordination-support-and-knowledge-sharing-associated-with-e-learning-where-does-your-organisation-fit/">A post</a> drawing on some insights from Alavi and Leidner (2001) about organisational implementation of e-learning. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/15/comparing-vleslms-to-the-past-flaws-and-implications-for-development-models/">A first post</a> to take a couple of lessons from history and apply it to LMS implementation. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/13/virtual-learning-environments-three-implementation-perspectives/">A summary</a> of a paper that applies some insights from information systems to e-learning implementation. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's the aim for next week?</h3>

<p>I'm hoping by this time next week that I'll have:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Completed at least 2 sections of the Ps Framework for Chapter 2 - probably "Past Experience" and "People".  If I'm motiviated, perhaps add "Product". </li>
  <li> Cleaned up a lot of the literature I've found in the last week. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, next week is shaping up to be a particular frustrating week from other perspectives, so it will be interesting to see if any of the above gets done.</p></p>
