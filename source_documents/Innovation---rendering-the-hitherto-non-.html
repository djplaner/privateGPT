<p>Tags: innovation, quotes, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>A lot of what I do could be seen as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation">innovation</a>. In the past I was a "faculty teaching and learning innovation officer" and I may well take on such a role in the future. Today, I came across the following quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_adams">Douglas Adams</a> which seems connected to the idea of innovation.</p>
<p><blockquote>It is a rare mind indeed that can render the hitherto non-existent blindingly obvious. The cry 'I could have thought of that' is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didn't, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too.</blockquote></p></p>
