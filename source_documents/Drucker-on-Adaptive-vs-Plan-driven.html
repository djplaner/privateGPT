<p>Peter Drucker from "The Effective Executive"
<blockquote>
"Most discussions of the knowledge worker's task start with the advice to plan one's work. This sounds eminently plausible. The only thing wrong with it is that it rarely works. The plans always remain on paper, always remain good intentions. They seldom turn into achievement."
</blockquote>

"Innovation and Entrepreneurship"
<blockquote>
"'Planning' as the term is commonly understood is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy....innovation , almost by definition, has to be decentralized, ad hoc, autonomous, specific and microeconomic."
</blockquote></p>
