<p>Tags: bam, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Received formal institutional approval yesterday to commence the process of porting <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BAM</a> into Moodle. This has two implications that spring to mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li> I get to learn a new development environment; and <br />For the last 13-15 years I've been doing my development in Perl. In the last 10 years or so, nice OO perl within a framework of my own devising. Now I have take a step backwards to PHP, and from what little I hear fairly primitive procedural PHP.  <p>I remember having a Perl versus PHP argument through proxy with a "young" developer about 7 or so years ago. I thought PHP was a recipe for horrible code - procedural, mixing HTML and code....uggh.   And guess what I'm doing now?</p> </li>
  <li> There's finally a fairly clear project/direction for the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/">new position</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>Three of the accountabilities for the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/">new position</a> include: relationships, communicate and public and continuous improvement. As part of fulfilling these accountabilities I plan to document the process of porting BAM into Moodle on this blog via the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/category/bam/">BAM category</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible, that as I learn more about Moodle, that the notion of BAM will change significantly in terms of implementation.  i.e. BAM may not become a stand alone module.  If there are other tools/services within Moodle that can provide the functionality (and I become aware of them), I'll lean towards using them.</p>
<p>The plan is to have this completed in time for it to be used from around mid-February 2010. Hopefully earlier.</p></p>
