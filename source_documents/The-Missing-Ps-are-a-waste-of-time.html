<p><a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52">The missing Ps framework</a> is very much under construction attempt to identify the holes and flaws in the methods used by Universities to evaluate and select a learning management system (LMS).

In reading around about this topic, in particular via a <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=54">document from George Siemens</a>, I came across a report funded by the Melbourne-Monash Collaboration in Educational Technologies,   <a href="http://www.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/telars/talmet/melbmonash/media/LMSGovernanceFinalReport.pdf">LMS Governance Project Report</a> (Wise and Quealy, 2006).

Skimming through this report I was struck by the following quote from the foreword
<blockquote>
We were also very mindful of the number of internal and external reviews of LMS and educational technology (not all of which were made available to us) and the <strong>lack of impact these reports appear to have had in decision-making</strong>.
</blockquote>

A great little quote to bring me back to ground.  The best that can come from this idea of the missing Ps is that I get a few publications and hopefully a couple of trips to nice places.  Assuming you ignore the personal value that will be generated by simply reading and thinking about this stuff.</p>
