It's been a week or so since I purchased the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/21/starting-a-new-journey-and-hobby-photography/">new camera</a>.  Last weekend I had to buy Aperture 2 for my Mac so I could easily pull the raw photos off the camera.  Have been fairly happy with that purchase and the photos have <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/21/first-photo/">flowed</a>.

<p>
I've only put 10 to 20 of them onto my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/">Flickr photostream</a>, a lot more sitting on the hard drive and I've yet to take on any assignments. I need to do this to start really learning something about photography, rather than simply some trial and error.
</p>
<p>
Of the photos I've placed on Flickr so far, the shot of the missus is the most visited.  Though that probably has something to do with the title and/or the subject, rather than the quality of the photography.
</p>
<p>
Was going to try and pick a favourite, but couldn't decide.  I don't mind this one of Zeke.

<h3>The next accessory</h3>

<p>
 Now it is time to think about the next additional expense/accessory for the camera, a tripod.
</p>
<p>
The missus and I are off to Paris in a week or so.  <a href="http://goparis.about.com/od/planningyourtrip/a/ParisDecember.htm">Paris in December</a> means lights. Night-time displays of decorative, Xmas lights along the Champs-Elysees and department stores. A tripod is likely to be required.
</p>
<p>
I'm somewhat reluctant to go the whole hog and get a "real" tripod.  The size, weight and apparent clumsiness of them suggest I don't want to be walking around Paris with one.  Which is why I was interested to see a <a href="http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/">gorillapod</a> in a local store.  It seemed small enough to fit into a bag.
</p>
<p>
There seem to have been some fairly positive reviews - <a href="https://sharedreviews.com/review/review_view/21410-photography-equipment-joby-gorillapod-joby-gorillapod">one</a> and <a href="http://www.backpackgeartest.org/reviews/Cameras/Photography%20Accessories/Joby%20Gorilla%20Pod/Test%20Report%20by%20Pamela%20Wyant/">two</a>, and one <a href="http://www.shadowsandlight.ca/reviews/review-of-joby-gorillapod-slr-zoom/">a little more restrained</a>, but still positive.
</p>
<p>
The last review makes the point that this is not a replacement for a real tripod.  Mmm, do I want/need one for what I want to do?
