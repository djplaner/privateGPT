<p>This time next year I should probably be teaching high school IT and maths. Because of this I've been thinking a lot about what type of teacher/educator/facilitator I'd like to be. What will be my ethos? I'm sure I'll be asked that in coming weeks as I study.

Making high school not suck. Engaging with students in making stuff that matters.

How that can be achieved within the constraints of existing organisations should be interesting.</p>
