<p><p>On Friday the 20th of Feb I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">the ANU</a> on my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">PhD</a>.  A <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/21/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-e-learning/">previous post</a> has some background and an overview of the presentation.</p>
<p>I recorded the presentation using my iPhone and <a href="http://appliedvoices.com/HappyTalk_Product_Site/HT_Professional_Recorder.html">the Happy Talk recorder application</a>. I've finally got the audio up and synchronised with the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> presentation. </p>
<p>Hopefully the presentation is embedded below, but I've had some problem embedding it in the blog (all the other slideshare presentations have been ok.</p>

[slideshare id=1050778&amp;doc=ANU_Version4-090220051156-phpapp01]

<p>Nope, the embedding doesn't want to work.  Bugger.  Here's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning">a link to the presentation page</a> on Slideshare.

<h3>Limitations of Slideshare</h3>

<p>In this presentation, along with most of my current presentations, I use an adapted form of the <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">"Lessig" method of presentation</a>. A feature of this method is a large number of slides (in my case 129 slides for a 30 minute presentation) with some of the slides being used for very small time frames - some less than a second.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> synchronisation tool appears to have a minimum time allowed for each slide - about 15 seconds.  At least that is what I found with this presentation. I think perhaps the limitation is due to the interface, or possibly my inability to use it appropriately.  </p>
<p>This limitation means that some of the slides in my talk are not exactly synchronised with the audio.</p>

<h3>The Happy Talk Recorder</h3>

<p>I'm very happy with it.  The quality of the audio is surprisingly good. Little or no problems in using it.  I think I will use it more.</p></p>
