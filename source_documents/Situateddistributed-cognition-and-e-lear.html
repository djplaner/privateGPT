<p><div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>This quote summarises very nicely what I think will become a major research interest of mine in the future.  i.e. how can we modify the environment - particularly, but not primarily, through information technology - within universities to encourage and enable improvements in teaching and learning?  <br />
<br />
I have a feeling/belief that heavyweight/top-down approaches to improving teaching (e.g. requiring all staff to have a formal teaching qualification, or specifying minimum standards of performance) simply don't work, at least not if you closely examine the cost/benefit ratio of these approaches.<br />
<br />
Instead, I am interested in the tools and representations that can be built into the higher education teaching environment to improve situated/distributed cognition and subsequently improve teaching. <br />
<br />
Once the thesis is finished, I'm hoping to have the time to look more closely at this.  Any suggestions on where to start reading?</p></div></div><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/452/rethinking-e-learning" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/452/rethinking-e-learning">www.learningsolutionsmag.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote cite="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/452/rethinking-e-learning" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><p id="AutoGeneratedID-0">This recognition that our processing uses external representations is an important component in looking at ways to support performance.

We need a richer picture of how we perform, rather than a simplistic and ineffectual model that posits we can know everything we need.</p><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/452/rethinking-e-learning" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/452/rethinking-e-learning">Read more at www.learningsolutionsmag.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/8mht">http://amplify.com/u/8mht</a></div><br /></p>
