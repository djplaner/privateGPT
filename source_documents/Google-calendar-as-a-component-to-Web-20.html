<p>Tags: bam, Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites, webfuse</p>

<p>A <a href="http://jasontoal.blogs.elinc.ca/2006/07/31/google-calendar-php-icalendar/">post from Simon Fraser University</a> talks about use of Google Calendar with some PHP code to manage calendars and bookings.

Another potential application for Web 2.0 course sites - the study schedule as a Google calendar.  Allow students to remix it with their own stuff.....lots of stuff here to think about and investigate.</p>
