<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Two weekly PhD updates in a row, will be interesting to see how long this keeps going.</p>

<h3>What I did last week</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/04/02/phd-update-25-a-return-to-discipline/">aim for this week</a> was to get chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis into first draft stage and sent to the supervisor for comment.  If possible, get chapter 4 into the same stage.</p>
<p>2 and 3 were sent on Tuesday. Chapter 4 is about 3/4 of the way into first draft stage.  Hope to have that done over the weekend.</p>
<p>The week has been slower than normal due to school holidays and other work.</p>

<h3>The aim for next week</h3>

<p>The time factor is going to raise its ugly head.  Found out today that a deadline for a grant application is now a month earlier than I thought - it's now May 4.  On the downside, that means that much of the time from now until May 4 will probably be spent working on that application.  On the plus side, I'll have some more free time after May 4 for the thesis.</p>
<p>For the next week, the plan is to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> get chapter 4 into first draft stage; </li>
  <li> get a rough version of chapter 6 completed; and</li>
  <li> if possible, get started on chapter 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>My ultimate goal is for submission by the end of June, or as close to that as I can get.</p></p>
