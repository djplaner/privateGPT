<p>I know of a few organisations that are currently undergoing that favourite past-time of all new management and the greatest fear of people in their new organisations, the organisational restructure.  As part of another thread of reading I came across a <a href="http://eclecticbill.blogspot.com/2006/04/wisdom-of-numbskulls.html">post</a> that has a nice take on these events.

<blockquote>
Too often, the top management hires a high-priced expert who claims to have the best knowledge while ignoring the numbskull advice of the front-line workers because they are deemed less educated or not as "sophisticated". All expert knowledge is limited to the fact that it is knowledge gained from experience. It is the rearview-mirror perspective of the world which, although can be very useful, is limited. The knowledge that counts in a new project and/or change effort is the tacit knowledge gained by the participants as they go through the change and learn from it. During a crisis or change, people will generate many numbskull ideas but they will also gain valuable insights that can later become the expert knowledge that creates a great CBOK.
