<p>Tags: thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>The following outlines the conditions for Anna's phone.</p>

<h3>We will provide</h3>

<ul>
  <li> A "pre-paid" phone of no more than $100. </li>
  <li> $20 a month (30 days) for phone charges. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Anna will</h3>

<p>A "manure unit" is one of a list of tasks around the house that require a similar amount of effort as getting the cow manure.</p>
<p>Complete her basic chores, these must be done regardless of the phone:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete all chores and parental directives with an absence of groaning, eye rolling and general displays of disquiet.</li>
  <li> Keep the silliness to somewhat less than 100% of the time. </li>
  <li> 2 manure units on the weekend. </li>
  <li> Be up and in the car at 7:30. No later. </li>
  <li> Work hard at school, including completing home work. </li>
  <li> After dinner, pack the dishwasher and ensure that the kitchen is clean. (i.e. benchtops and table wiped, bits and pieces put away)<br />This includes putting the lid on the &amp;*$% dishwashing tablets)</li>
  <li> Keep her room tidy (i.e. dirty washing in laundry etc.) </li>
</ul>
<p>It is recognised that this list does not include the need to go over to the pump.  So, Anna is better off under this regime.</p>
<p>In return for the phone, Anna will</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete another two manure units during the week. </li>
</ul>
<p>Conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Anna may complete the 2 manure units on the weekend on the same day. </li>
  <li> The two manure units during the week must be completed during the week. They cannot be done on the weekend. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional conditions may be added, or some removed, after discussion between all parties. (This does not necessarily mean that all parties have agreed. In the end, what the parents decide applies. However, we will not seek to be draconian.)</p>

<h3>Phone rules</h3>

<p>Use of the phone must follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li> All school rules regarding phone usage must be followed.</li>
  <li> At 8:30pm on weekdays and 10:30pm on weekends (Fri and Sat night) the phone must be placed on top of the fridge and stay there (i.e. not be used). </li>
  <li> No use of the phone in communal areas of the house (i.e. at the dinner table, sitting watching TV).  Using the phone is a private thing, done in private.</li>
  <li> The $20 recharge must last 30 days. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional rules may be applied after discussion between all parties.  (This does not necessarily mean that all parties have agreed. In the end, what the parents decide applies. However, we will not seek to be draconian.)</p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>The following penalties may apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li> With a minor offense, the $20 recharge may be delayed for a period determined by the parents. </li>
  <li> With a major offense, the phone will be confiscated for a period determined by the parents. </li>
</ul></p>
