<p>Tags: Chapter 2, phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>After 12 weekly updates I missed one last week as the missus and I went on a holiday, ate some nice meals (e.g. <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/27/a-night-at-ezard/">this one</a>), and purchased a new car.  This time last week I was driving the new car out of Brisbane on the way home, hence no update.</p>
<p>Not that there was much need.  Thanks to the holiday very little work was done.  Since then we've played with the kids to catch up on being away, enjoyed a public holiday and this week I've actually worked (instead of PhD work) for two days. Consequently, there's still not a lot to report.</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>

<p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/23/phd-update-12-some-progress-but-late/">Last week</a>, I said I would</p>
<ul><li> Complete the process component, or as much as I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't complete it. Had I not had to work Tuesday and Thursday I think I would have actually achieved a target.  Instead, I have completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  an <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/25/teleological-and-ateleological-processes/">overview</a> of teleological and ateleological processes; </li>
  <li> a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/05/teleological-design-definition-and-weaknesses/">description of teleological processes and their weaknesses</a>; and </li>
  <li> a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/05/ateleological-processes-definition-and-weaknesses/">description of ateleological processes and their weaknesses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves two sections to complete in process:</p>
<ul>
  <li> University processes; and <br />This bit will give an overview of the types of processes generally used by Universities for management, learning and e-learning. It will highlight that they are generally teleological, even though literature suggests otherwise.</li>
  <li> Lessons from process.<br />A brief summary of the lessons I think can be drawn from considerations of process for e-learning. Don't think it's any surprise that I will argue that for learning and e-learning there should be a greater use of ateleological process and less of the teleological.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have also been a few blog posts in that time, all somewhat associated to the thesis.  The main connection is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/02/the-lmsvle-as-a-one-word-language-metaphor-and-e-learning/">this one</a> about the LMS as a one word language.  It is inspired by the paper that gave me the concept of teleological and ateleological processes. The sentiment also connects closely with my thoughts for the thesis.</p>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>Next week is likely to be a somewhat shortened week (public holiday, other family commitments and some work) but no where near as much as the last fortnight.</p>
<p>For the next week, I'm hoping I can</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete the process component. </li>
  <li> Make significant progress on the People component. </li>
</ul></p>
