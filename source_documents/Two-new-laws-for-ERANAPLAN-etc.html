<p><div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>For the last few years some colleagues and I have been watching the rise of managerialism within higher education, and more recently in K12 education. <br />
<br />
Typically implemented as some vast activity - e.g. <a href="http://www.naplan.edu.au/">a nationalised literacy and numeracy test for all Australian school children</a>, or the reduction of <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/era/">research quality to some numbers</a> - that takes a complex task and reduces it to some sort of ranking.<br />
<br />
In response, we've been banging on about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law</a><blockquote>states that once a social or economic indicator or other surrogate measure is made a target for the purpose of conducting social or economic policy, then it will lose the information content that would qualify it to play such a role.</blockquote><br />
<br />
i.e. once you establish NAPLAN test results as indicating quality and linking it to funding, the value of NAPLAN test results as a measure of quality (if there ever was any value) is no gone as people will "play the game".<br />
<br />
It's good (and somewhat frustrating) to know that we in Australia are not alone in this globalisation influences, accountability mad rush to task corruption.<br />
<br />
Mark Guzdial identifes two additional but related "laws" (Goodhart's and Campbell's seem to be quite close) in commenting on <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-03-06-school-testing_N.htm">this article from USA Today</a>. An article that details some fairly widespread apparent examples of Goodhart's law.<br />
<br />
How long before one of the Australian newspapers or other media outlets does a similar analysis?</p></div></div><div class=""><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/">computinged.wordpress.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote cite="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div class="TxtCntnt">Dukenfield&#8217;s Law &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/bsRokM" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/bsRokM&gt;:</a> &#8220;If a thing is worth winning,  it&#8217;s worth cheating for.&#8221;</div></td></tr></table></blockquote><div class="Amp_Content_Hr"></div><blockquote cite="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div class="TxtCntnt">Campbell&#8217;s Law &lt;<a rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/hMsyUr&gt;:</a> &#8220;The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision making, the more subject it  will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and  corrupt the social processes&#160; it is intended to monitor.&#8221;</div><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/when-test-scores-seem-too-good-to-believe-usatoday-com/">Read more at computinged.wordpress.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/bxcio">http://amplify.com/u/bxcio</a></div><br /></p>
