<p><p>Dave Cormier has <a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2010/08/01/open-learning-what-i-have-learned/">presented 8 hypotheses</a> summarising what he's learned about open learning. I've been meaning to post about it for a day or so, there is some really good stuff here. Some really important insights that formal education institutions need to think about, especially those wishing to ride the online learning revolution into the greener fields of growing student markets.</p>
<p>I'm posting this now because <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=53034">Stephen Downes has picked up</a> on the couple of sentences of Dave's post which I think summarise exactly why it will be very difficult for some formal educational institutions to even consider learning from Dave's hypotheses.  Here's the quote from Dave's post<blockquote>One of the biggest advantages of openness (and it is one of the things that connects all of the points here) is the messiness of the process. It allows for the unexpected good and bad, to pop into a learning scenario. It approximates real life in a way that is sadly lacking from the majority of our educational encounters</blockquote></p>

<h3>"Strategic" management and its problem with messiness</h3>

<p>For a long time (I have seen quotes going back to the early 1900s) universities have been exhorted to be run more like commercial businesses. This is typically code for having strong, strategic leadership. In turn this translates into having a firmly accepted vision of where the institution is going and how it is going to get there. It is efficient, nothing is wasted on extraneous activities that do not contribute to pre-identified missions and methods.  Everything is consistent. It is tidy.</p>
<p>In some/most cases this drive for consistency, or perhaps better phrased as "an absence of messiness",  results in <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/05/08/why-dont-we-e-learn-over-emphasis-on-rationality-and-defensive-routines/">defensive routines</a> and the <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/SNAFU-principle.html">SNAFU principle</a>. A consequence of the SNAFU principle is the "progressive disconnection of decision-makers from reality".
</p>
<p>This could be phrased alternatively as, the further you progress up the organisational ladder, the cleaner the world seems. Any messiness is to kept out because it makes life "difficult".  </p>

<h3>Hypothesis #1</h3>

<p>Perhaps it's time to start proposing some hypothesis of my own, in this case, about how to improve L&amp;T within a university.  Here's #1.<blockquote><em>Hypothesis 1 - Embrace the messiness</em><br />Open learning is messy. Innovation and chance are messy. Learning and teaching within a complex setting, are messy.  To implement widespread change in learning and teaching a university has to actively embrace and engage with messiness.</blockquote></p>
<p>Mmm, this approach could actually produce something a bit more positive and actually contribute to the thesis. Speaking of which...</p></p>
