<p>Tags: elearning, missingPs, Uncategorized</p>

<p><a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52">The Missing Ps framework</a> is my attempt to generate a way of identifying the flaws in the methods used by Universities to select an LMS.

This post is the first step in expanding out one of the Ps into more detail.  This post covers "Product".  Like the other posts in this discussion, this is a work in progress.  I'm following the open source model - release early and often - though I'll probably succeed more at the early, than the often.

The sections to (eventually) be covered here include:
<ul>
  <li> The product fascination - this is just about the only thing they concentrate on.</li>
  <li> The LMS model - what it encapsulates </li>
  <li> The limitations of this model </li>
  <li> The alternatives - what other options are being considered/are available </li>
  <li> The broader product picture </li>
</ul>

<strong>The Product Fascination</strong>

Almost all LMS evaluations become comparisons of product features.

<strong>The LMS model</strong>

Almost all current LMSes encapsulate the same basic model which Blackboard recently obtained a patent for.

<strong>The limitations of the LMS model</strong>

<blockquote>
First generation e-learning systems tend to focus almost entirely on the management and measurement of training processes. They add little or no value to the learning process. Furthermore, they do not provide any means to support internal content production processes, relying instead on commercial courseware. These ‘‘learning management systems’’ (LMS) were seen to be nothing more than launch pads for third party content that the organization would purchase or outsource. (Ismail 2002)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The role and importance of technology in the development of e-learning systems is often overstated by technology providers. It is often stated that the deployment of an LMS alone is all it takes to implement e-learning. The problem is, in many cases the development of e-learning projects devolved into a purely technical process, resulting in expensive software implementations, essentially unused by uninformed, fearful, or resentful employees. (Ismail 2002)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Most LMS vendors deliberately distance themselves from pedagogical issues, often adopting an indifferent attitude or sometimes even trying to disguise it as a praiseworthy act of impartiality. This finding is coherent with Firdiyiyek’s (1999) argument that there is a serious mismatch between the abundance of features in LMS and the lack or total absence of explanation on the pedagogy underlying the inclusion of these tools. (Govindasamy, 2002)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Often many features and tools of LMS are left unused. This is a terrible waste of resources since these tools account for the cost of implementing e-Learning. In a worse case scenario, the tools may end up being used in a manner entirely opposed to pedagogical principles, and in turn, will hamper learning. In either case, the impact inevitably will be reflected in the return on the e-Learning investment. (Govindasamy, 2002)
</blockquote>

<strong>The alternatives</strong>

A <a href="http://www.educause.edu/er/erm06/erm0643.asp">recent EDUCAUSE article</a> suggests
<blockquote>
Furthermore, we need to investigate the limitations and shortcomings of current L/CMS systems so as to determine whether the existing system design has the capacity to fulfill the needs and requirements of today’s learners and other stakeholders.
</blockquote>

The current LMS model encapsulates three assumptions
<ol>
  <li> One application provides all the services </li>
  <li> That application is hosted by a single entity - usually the University </li>
  <li> Only members of the host institution can get access </li>
</ol>

The same <a href="http://www.educause.edu/er/erm06/erm0643.asp">EDUCAUSE Review article</a> mentioned above includes the following
<blockquote>
Interestingly, today all major L/CMS products, both commercial and open source, are using a system design and framework very similar to that of the original L/CMS system invented in the mid-to-late 1990s. This system uses a dedicated or isolated L/CMS computer server that services a campus community or several campuses within a university system. The L/CMS software may run within a computer server located on the campus, or it may use a hosting service, which in most cases is supplied via an ISP (Internet Service Provider) by the vendor marketing the L/CMS software. Under this model, L/CMS services and collaboration are characteristically limited to members of that institution.
</blockquote>

The rise of Web 2.0 means that neither of these assumptions need, nor possibly should, hold.  I've talked about the concept of <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=15">Web 2.0 course sites</a> elsewhere as a stepping stone from the current comfort zone to something more radical (dropping the course sites entirely).

The recent announcement of <a href="https://www.google.com/a/edu/">Google Apps for Education</a> makes this even more likely.  Other institutions are also aware of this idea. A report from Monash/Melbourne Unis <a href="http://www.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/telars/talmet/melbmonash/media/LMSGovernanceFinalReport.pdf">(Wise and Quealy, 2006)</a> suggests
<blockquote>
Broader innovative opportunities exist in terms of the possibility of partnering with popular Web 2.0 service providers (eg Yahoo, Google, MySpace. Flickr) for interactive web services in the same way as universities currently provide academic versions of popular software. Instead of having to log in to a range of online services depending whether it is for personal use, work use, or for study, a student could login to their service of choice for each functionality, and link the service back to their university course or other activity. Online access to the university through partner service providers could act as a ‘virtual gateway’ to the university. This would be the online equivalent of coming on to the physical campus.
</blockquote>

Ismail (2002) talks about three types of systems
<ol>
  <li> Learning design system (LDS)
Alloow the quick anlysis and esign of instructionaly sound learning programs.
<blockquote>
Many e-learning projects do not realize their full potential because they fail to adequately meet basic instructional goals and objectives. In the worst cases, these goals and objectives are never even defined beyond a broad statement of direction. The key to developing effective material lies in combining clear learning goals with pedagogical models. Often this is not done because content developers are not trained in instructional design principles.
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> Learning Content Management System (LCMS)
Provide a collaborative authoring environment for the content.  Enable workflow between SMEs, content developers and media developers.
  </li>
  <li> Learning Support System (LSS)
Web environment for supporting the teaching and learning activities.
<blockquote>
While most LMSs tend to provide these capabilities, the features implement in the LMS has tended to support self-directed learning. While this is an important mode of online learning, e-learning should be first and foremost about creating a social space that must be managed for the teaching and learning needs of the particular group of people inhabiting that space. This requires a platform that can be easily modified to take into consideration the needs of the particular learners in the course.
</blockquote>
</ol>

Derek Wenmoth has a <a href="http://blog.core-ed.net/derek/2006/10/ples_and_mles.html">post/image</a> covering the difference between PLEs (owned/managed by student) and MLEs (owned/managed by University).

<strong>The broader product picture</strong>

<blockquote>
Instead, designers should seek to understand the basic components of what constitutes an e-learning ‘‘ecosystem.’’ This systems framework is crucial in guiding the decisions relating to the choice and development of each component in relation to the objectives outlined in the organizational e-learning strategy. The framework will specify a learning systems architecture for pedagogical development and systems integration. Learning and the needs associated with supporting learning evolve and change over time, and so should learning systems. The reference architecture provided by a systems framework will allow an organization to progressively select and construct systems depending on requirements and budget. (Ismail 2002)
</blockquote>

Ismail (2002) then goes on to talk about the Learning Technologies Systems Architecture as a reference model.  This will need to be mentioned but it will need to be translated into something CQU specific, something a little more concrete, to enable people to more easily grasp it.
