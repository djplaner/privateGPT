<p>Tags: design theory, elearning, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>My <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">thesis</a> is an example <a href="http://ais.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=279">information systems design research</a>.  However, since the aim of the thesis is to develop a design theory for the implementation of e-learning within a university I do have some interest in the design-based research (DBR) literature from the education discipline.</p>

<p>I'm current following a discussion about DBR within education on the <a href="http://it.coe.uga.edu/itforum/">ITForum mailing list</a> on which a number of folk are sharing resources, resources I'm not going to be able to read now.  The purpose of this post is to save those references so I can perhaps (yea, right) go back and read them at some later stage.
