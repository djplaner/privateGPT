<p><p>Came across the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1305716/Nobody-likes-gooder-Study-confirms-selfless-behaviour-alienating.html">article, "Nobody likes a do-gooder: Study confirms selfless behaviour is alienating"</a> from the Daily Mail via <a href="http://morgaine.amplify.com/2010/08/24/nobody-likes-a-do-gooder/">Morgaine's amplify</a>. I'm wondering if there's a connection between this and the chasm in the adoption of instructional technology identified by Geoghegan (1994) </p>

<h3>The chasm</h3>

<p>Back in 1994, Geoghegan draw on Moore's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm">Crossing the Chasm</a> to explain why instructional technology wasn't being adopted by the majority of university academics. The suggestion is that there is a significant difference between the early adopters of instructional technology and the early majority. That what works for one group, doesn't work for the others. There is a chasm.  Geoghegan (1994) also suggested that the "technologists alliance" - vendors of instructional technology and the university folk charged with supporting instructional technology - adopt approaches that work for the early adopters, not the early majority.</p>

<h3>Nobody likes do-gooders</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1305716/Nobody-likes-gooder-Study-confirms-selfless-behaviour-alienating.html">Daily Mail article</a> reports on some psychological research that draws some conclusions about how "do-gooders" are seen by the majority<blockquote>Researchers say do-gooders come to be resented because they 'raise the bar' for what is expected of everyone.</blockquote></p>
<p>This resonates with my experience as an early adopter and more broadly with observations of higher education.  The early adopters, those really keen on learning and teaching are seen a bit differently by those that aren't keen. I wonder if the "raise the bar" issue applies?  Would imagine this could be quite common in a higher education environment where research retains its primacy, but universities are under increasing pressure to improve their learning and teaching. And more importantly show to everyone that they have improved.</p>
<p>The complete study is outlined in a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/99/2/303/">journal article</a>.</p>
