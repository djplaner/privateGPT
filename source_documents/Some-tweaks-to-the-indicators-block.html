<p>Tags: indicators, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Yesterday's <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/05/13/getting-started-with-cols-indicators-block/">post</a> introduced Col's initial work on the indicators block.  This post reports on some minor tweaks I've been doing this afternoon, trying to find escape in something concrete.</p>

<h3>Setting the title</h3>

<p>As reported in the last post, the block ended up having a title <em>[[Indicators]]</em>.  This was because get_string was being used to set the title but the necessary language file (from which to source the string) was not created.</p>
<p>First fix is to just hard code the title.</p>
[sourcecode lang="php"]
$this-&gt;title = "Indicators"; //get_string('Indicators','block_indicators');
[/sourcecode]
<p>That works. But the proper solution would be to figure out where the "lang" file should go for a block.  According to <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=41061">this</a>, it should be lang/en/block_BLOCKNAME.php. Small problem, that should be lang/en_utf8, not lang/en (as per <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=149971">here</a>).</p>
[sourcecode lang="php"]
$this-&gt;title = get_string("indicators","block_indicators");
[/sourcecode]
<p>Will commit those changes.</p>

<h3>How to distinguish user roles?</h3>

<p>The block was using roleid=5 as a way to identify students.  I believe this is a deprecated approach. So need to find a better way.  In my wonderings, I came across an approach that users the has_capability function along with some "legacy" capabilities for student, staff, guest and admin.  The following is an early example from the block</p>
[sourcecode lang="php"]
if ( has_capability( 'moodle/legacy:teacher', $context )) {
    print "This is a teacher&lt;br /&gt;";
} else if ( has_capability( 'moodle/legacy:student', $context )) {
    print "This is a student&lt;br /&gt;";
    $canview=0;
}
[/sourcecode]

<h3>What's next</h3>

<p>At least in my head, the plan is to enable different groups of users to see different sets of "indicators".  Where an "indicator" is a single graphic.  This means that we need an good way to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> distinguish between different users; </li>
  <li> call different code to generate the indicators for the different users; </li>
  <li> distinguish which indicator a user wishes to see; </li>
  <li> call different code based on the indicator.</li>
</ul>
<p>A nice structure to do that, might be next on the list. If I was in Perl, I'd be doing this with a factory class.  Should we go OO in PHP?</p>
<p>  Some other tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li> I'm getting errors when running the block as a teacher.

 </li>
  <li> What should an admin user see when they view the block? </li>
  <li> Check the performance of the existing SQL code and think about how/what we might need to do to significantly reduce that. </li>
</ul></p>
