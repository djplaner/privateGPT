<p>Tags: connectedcourses</p>

<p>So once again I venture into the realm of a "MOOC".  Will be interesting to see if the organisers of <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/">Connected Courses</a> shudder a little bit when that particular label is used.  Especially given that Connected Courses is being described as<blockquote>Connected Courses is a collaborative community of faculty in higher education developing networked, open courses that embody the principles of connected learning and the values of the open web.</blockquote>

With a mission of <blockquote>Our goal is to build an inclusive and expansive network of teachers, students, and educational offerings that makes high quality, meaningful, and socially connected learning available to everyone.</blockquote>  It does have a <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/thecourse/">Syllabus</a> so there are some artefacts of a "course".  That said there are some very <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/about/people/">interesting people</a> behind it, so should be lots to learn and fun to be had.  If I get the chance to engage fully.

The main reason for this fairly rambling post is to ensure that I have at least one post in the "connectedcourses" category on this blog.  I'm trying to connect my blog to the course and the advice is<blockquote>Please make sure this URL works and links to the place to the place that shows your tagged/categorized blog posts. If you have not written any, do not proceed. The wheels may fall off your bus (just kidding)-- there needs to be at least ONE post visible at this address when when you enter it in a web browser</blockquote>

Seems the aggregator they are using has the same problem with empty feeds as <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a>. I have to give the same advice to folk in my courses. I wonder if the need is as slightly annoying to them as it is to me. There's also the problem with finding the feeds for categories/tags, rather than the whole site. Slightly reaffirming that these folk are having the same problems, but also a challenge to see if I can modify BIM to address these issues.

I had hoped to have relocated this blog to my <a href="http://djon.es/">shiny new domain</a> by now, but time hasn't been in abundance recently. Likely to be a recurring theme over coming months.</p>
