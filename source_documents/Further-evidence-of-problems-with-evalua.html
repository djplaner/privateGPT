<p>Tags: quotes, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>In a couple of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/01/25/somethings-that-are-broken-with-evaluation-of-university-teaching/">recent posts</a> (and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/13/the-emperor-has-no-clothes-why-is-the-learning-and-teaching-peformance-fund-naked/">this one</a>) I've essentially been arguing that most evaluation of teaching at universities is actually worse the useless.  The following quote from White (2006) provides some additional ammunition.</p>
<p><blockquote>Research has suggested that grade leniency is the most significant factor in positive evaluation of teaching (Greenwald &amp; Gilmore, 1997; Marsh &amp; Roche, 2000). These pressures may be resulting in grade inflation by some teachers and departments, and concomitantly, unrealistic student expectations with respect to the marks they should be awarded.</blockquote></p>
