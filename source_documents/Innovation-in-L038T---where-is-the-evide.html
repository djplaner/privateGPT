<p><div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>The dissonance between the lived experience of academics and students having to deal with institutional innovations in learning and teaching, and the outcomes reported by institutional evaluations of those innovations is a growing concern for me.  As top-down management gets involved in these innovations, in directing what they are and how they should be done, it doesn't seem that the accompanying gathering of evidence and critical reflection is coming along with it.<br />
<br />
Too often the folk evaluating innovations (or at least paying for them), are the folk who decided what the innovation should be or were responsible for implementing it. This strikes me as having significant potential for bias, including unintentional bias.<br />
<br />
And this is but one problem associated with evaluating innovations in L&amp;T.<br />
<br />
It seems the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative are attempting to address this. My one worry is that ELI tend to be very "North American"/techno-rational when it comes to research and evaluation. They seem to want to reduce everything to a survey that is applied to 100s even 1000s of institutions in the belief that it is capturing a true and objective picture.<br />
<br />
Shall be interesting to see how it develops.</p></div></div><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ELI/EDUCAUSELearningInitiative/SeekingEvidenceofImpact/206622" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.educause.edu/ELI/EDUCAUSELearningInitiative/SeekingEvidenceofImpact/206622">www.educause.edu</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote cite="http://www.educause.edu/ELI/EDUCAUSELearningInitiative/SeekingEvidenceofImpact/206622" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>As critical as these decisions are, the information available about the impact of these innovations is often scarce, uneven, or both.
