<p>What is <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=39FEBF669D4D5EF4!4173&amp;ithint=file%2cdocx&amp;app=Word&amp;authkey=!AMlbDPUeJDYdjg8">Wikity</a>?

I have a feeling I may not be able to give a good answer to that. That's part of the point of the work this post starts. Play around with Wikity and explore some possibilities.

At the moment, I see Wikity as a new style of mindtool. One that might be useful for me personally, but may also be really useful for much more than just my personal use. It's a Wiki type tool that runs on top of Wordpress and is informed by the ideas of Federated Wiki. It's the most recent instantiation of thinking from <a href="https://hapgood.us/about/">Mike Caufield</a>.

The plan here is to install the <a href="https://hapgood.us/2016/04/20/wikity-version-0-3-released/">0.3 version of Wikity</a> on my under utilised <a href="http://djon.es/">Reclaim Hosting site</a>.
<h3>Log</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new sub-domain <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/">http://wikity.djon.es</a>
Straight forward</li>
	<li>Install Wordpress - multisite</li>
	<li>Import the wikity theme - and hey it's working - at least the home page has changed</li>
	<li>Install the auto-upload images plugin
Wordpress wants to update this plugin, but advice for Wikity is not to.</li>
	<li>Start creating some initial cards
<ol>
	<li>"social" bookmark "Wik-it" with "<a href="http://www.saylor.org/2016/04/blog-oer-as-a-participatory-activity/">OER as a participatory activity</a>" creating <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/oer-as-a-participatory-activity-saylor-academy/">this card</a>.</li>

<h3>Title-Abstract-Treatment-Connections</h3>
Getting Wikity installed was always going to be the easy part. Figuring out how to use it productively and integrate that use into my regular practice was going to be the challenge.

The <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=39FEBF669D4D5EF4!4173&amp;ithint=file%2cdocx&amp;app=Word&amp;authkey=!AMlbDPUeJDYdjg8">Wikity introduction</a> positions "Title-Abstract-Treatment-Connections" as the best structure for a card.  It encourages people to engage with this by creating a new card, I'm wondering if I can edit an existing one (it's a wiki, of course you can, is my expectation).

Mmm, the edit link in the card view brings up the Wordpress edit screen. Wonder how that will work with markdown? But the catalog view gives the more markdown view.

The focus in wikity is not to summarise the article/resource, but to capture the idea.  Something I'm somewhat terrible at, and need to practice more.

Connections to other cards is important let's try that be adding one on the Reusability Paradox. Oh nice, the auto image upload works. Though have to use the full syntax for the image.

Paths look interesting.

Use of Wordpress pages could be useful for some of my potential applications of Wikity.
<h3>Copying other people's work</h3>
Given I've self-installed wikity separate from others, can I still copy cards from others?

The docs don't appear to yet touch on that, let's try it out.  Find an <a href="http://rainystreets.wikity.cc/engineering-the-right/">intersting card</a>, and try to copy it.  Stick in the URL for my wikity and hit copy.

Nice, <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/engineering-the-right/">that worked</a>. Mmm, but it appears that the connection Mike made to another card (Ideology of Disgust) doesn't come across correctly.  Or is that because he hasn't written that card yet?  No, he <a href="http://rainystreets.wikity.cc/the-ideology-of-disgust/?path=&amp;t=The%20Ideology%20of%20Disgust">created it</a>.

Time to add another <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/the-new-system-will-solve-everything-disease/">personal connection</a> to it. Something I've been thinking about recently.

All that seems to be working.
<h3>Further applications</h3>
I can see some definite applications personally, as long as I have the discipline. Wonder if Diigo's days are numbered? At least for personal use.

Beyond that there are some potentially interesting contributions Wikity can help with ideas around the BAD mindset, <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/scaffolding-context-sensitive-conglomerations-v2-0/">CASA</a>, and some sort of foundation for a <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/">"distributed TPACK" approach</a>.

Also some potential for teaching.  It would be a good fit for Networked and Global Learning.

All I need is time.

The immediate application might be to <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/designing-a-collection-of-analytics-to-explore-engagement/">this project</a> that is supporting a group of teacher educators using analytics to understand what's going on in the courses.
