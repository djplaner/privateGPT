After our <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/12/16/a-night-at-lassere/">big night out at Lasserre</a> Saturday morning saw us walking down to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musee_d%27orsay">Musee D'Orsay</a>.
</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3106189593/" title="The Grand Palais by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img align="left" alt="The Grand Palais" height="148" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/3106189593_f9f29abc52_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>
<p>
So once again we traipsed down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs_Elysees">Champs Elysees</a>, which is starting to feel like an old friend and perhaps just a bit boring.  Perhaps it is time for us to broaden our coverage of Paris beyond just this little bit.  But not today.  Part of the walk takes us passed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais">Grand Palais</a>
</p>
<p>
As with the Louvre there was a line to get through security, a good 10/15 minute wait and then only three or four folk in front of me for tickets. Both Sandy and I have commented that visiting these places during peak times must involved some horrendous numbers of people and long, long waiting times.  Even in Winter, most of these places are fairly busy.

<p>
The Musee D'Orsay is an old, big, train station converted nicely into a musuem. It includes a lot of paintings and sculptures and by the end, having only seen a subset of the total, both Sandy and I were cultured out.  Though I must admit that some of this was due to jet lag, a lot of walking and some aches and pains.  One nice place to sit and relax was a small break in the paintings which gave a view outside towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_du_Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris">Sacre Coeur</a>.
</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3107021772/" title="A Monet? by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img align="left" alt="A Monet?" height="186" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/3107021772_c471e01bf1_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>
<p>
So, obviously there had to be some photos taken of paintings. One which I think was a Monet, but I could be wrong. And of course the one below is a little more obvious in its origins. Of course Sandy thinks that the most memorable painting, much to her chagrin, was the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ddalledo/1149225055/">L'Origine du monde</a>. In Sandy's defense it is quite a striking painting and it was essentially the last one we saw before we left.

<p>
On leaving the Musee D'Orsay we discovered that it had started to rain. Given the low single digit temperatures and that we were a good 5Km walk from home, this was not a welcome development.  As it happened one of the bus companies that do a fixed route around Paris had a stop at the Musee d'Orsay and we got on that to get out of the rain and be taken home.
</p>
<p>
The excitement machines we are led us to have a late and large lunch. The premise being that we'd eat lots now, go back to the apartment and have an early night. The onion soup I had for an entree was very nice. The rest of the meal wasn't up to that level.  Sandy in particular lucked out with a cold rack of lamb for her main course.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat disappointed we returned to the apartment, stopping off to buy some red, bread and other necessities and then spent the rest of the evening reading before retiring early.  Tomorrow visitors are due to arrive.
