<p>A couple of days ago (Feb 1st, 2007) I started a new job at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a>.  A job that will give me lot more cause to "edublog", but at the same time restrict exactly what I can blog.

I am the new Head of E-Learning and Materials Development at CQU.  What this essentially means is that I am in charge of both the curriculum design group (the e-learning in the title) and the group currently responsible for much of the print production (the materials development).

The situation at CQU, as I see it, is summarised as follows
<ul>
  <li> Instructional/curriculum design has been let slide, just a bit. </li>
  <li> The organisation, which originally was a large print-based distance education provider, hasn't handled the advent of e-learning well. </li>
  <li> Print and e-learning/online are treated very separately. </li>
  <li> The complexity of the institution's operations have increased considerably over the last 10 years. <br />
     For example,  12,000 students in 1996 to 30,000 in 2007. In 1996 98% students were studying at the main campus or via distance education. By 2006, that was down to 49.5%.  In 2006, at least 50% of the students where from a non-english speaking background (NESB). </li>
  <li> The Australian Universities Quality Agency (<a href="http://www.auqa.edu.au/">AUQA</a>) audit of CQU had a few things to say about curriculum design. </li>
</ul>

A challenging situation, but one that promises lots of interesting discussion and thought.  I'm hoping to use the blog as a place to air some initial ideas that will develop into something that might get tried in action at CQU.</p>
