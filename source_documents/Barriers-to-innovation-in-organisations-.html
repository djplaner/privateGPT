<p><p>This video speaks to me on so many levels. It summarises many of the problems I have faced and encountered trying to implement innovative approaches to e-learning at universities over the last 15 plus year. I'm sure I am not alone.</p>
<p>Today, I've spent a lot of time not directly related to what I wanted to achieve. Consequently, I had planned not to do or look at anything else until I'd finished.  But this video resonates so strongly  that I couldn't resist watching, downloading it and blogging it.</p>
<p>I came across the video from <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/">a post by Punya Mishra</a>. Some more on this after the video. I should also link <a href="http://www.opennasa.com/2009/01/28/barriers-to-innovation-and-inclusion/">to the blog post</a> on the OpenNASA site. Would your University/organisation produce something similar?</p>
<p>If <a href="http://nonamuldoon.wordpress.com/">Nona</a> ever gets around to watching this video, I am sure she will see me in a slightly different role in the video. Until recently I had the misfortune to be in the naysayer role. That's no longer the case.  Who said no good could come of organisational restructures?</p>

<h3>The benefits of being open</h3>

<p>Coming across this video, provides further evidence to support an <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/11/the-value-of-being-open/">earlier post</a> I made today on the values of being open.  I became aware of Punya's post because of the following process:</p>
<ul><li>Almost a year ago Punya <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2008/03/18/site-2008-keynote/">published this post</a> on his blog that openly shares the video of a keynote he and Mat Koehler gave. </li>
  <li> I came across it not long afterwards through my interest in <a href="http://www.tpck.org/">TPACK</a> (formerly known as TPCK).</li>
  <li> About two weeks ago I decided to use part of the video in some <a href="http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/">sessions</a> I was running on course analysis and design.</li>
  <li> A couple of days ago I blogged on an important part of the presentation (not used in the sessions I ran) that resonated with my PhD work. </li>
  <li> My blog software told Punya's blog software about my post and added it as a <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2008/03/18/site-2008-keynote/#comment-29919">comment to his blog</a>. </li>
  <li> This afternoon <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/">Google Alerts</a> sent me an email that <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/">this page</a> on Punya's blog was linking to my blog (because of the comment - see the comments section in the right hand menu). </li>
  <li> Out of interest (some might say in the interest of procrastination) I followed the link and saw the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to use parts of this video in future presentations around my PhD research. I believe it will resonate with people so much better than me simply describing the abstract principles. </p>
<p>So while not directly contributing to what I wanted to do today. It's provided with a great advantage in the future.</p>


 of a Google Alert I have set on my site.  Google emailed me to say that Punya had made this post because his blog software includes a list of the

I've spent a lot of time today doing stuff not necessarily directly related to what I wanted to achieve today. To such an extent I'd decided not to blog anymore.</p>
