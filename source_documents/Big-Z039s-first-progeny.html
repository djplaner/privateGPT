<p><p>October last year we purchased Wandilla Zanzibar - Big Z from the big Brahman sales in Rocky. He was the new bull for the small number of remnants of our might herd of cattle.</p>

<p>Almost 10 months to the day when he arrived on our place, the first of his progeny arrived. Two have arrived so far, going by appearance we can expect a number more over coming weeks. </p>

<p>Of course, this means that at some stage in the next couple of months there will be the additional chores of castration and de-horning to perform.</p></p>
