<p>
In a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/">previous blog post</a> I tried/am trying to kick off an experiment in using a blog for a multi-person discussion as an attempt to answer a question we will have to address as part of the PLEs@CQUni project.
</p>
<p>
I'm hoping this is a party to which a few others will come.
</p>
<p>
This post is an attempt to illustrate one answer to the "mechanics" question, i.e. how might you do this and also to provide some pointers to existing information on this topic.
</p>

<h3>The mechanics</h3>

<p>I'm posting this on my own blog, hosted on Wordpress.com.  If I include a link to the previous post (as I did in the first sentence of this post) Wordpress automatically tells the other blog, which then adds a link to the new blog post. The author of the original blog post gets an email from Wordpress saying that someone has linked to the post.  The linkage shows up in the management interface of Wordpress.
</p>
<p>
If you <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/">visit the previous blog post</a> you should now see a link back to this post towards the bottom.
</p>
<p>
In theory, this allows each of the participants know when someone comments on their posts.  It provides a set of connections between the different blogs, a way of generating a view of the discussion.
</p>

<h3>Some resources</h3>

<p>
This is not a new exercise, some existing information includes
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2007/02/blogs-vs-discussion-groups.html">Blogs vs. Discussion Groups: eLearning Technology</a><br />
      A post arising from a debate in another group and offering a collection of pointers to other related resources.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.chrislott.org/2006/01/25/blogs-vs-discussion-boards-for-education/">Blogs vs. Discussion boards for education</a> <br />
       A brief comparison of blogs versus discussion boards.
  </li>
</ul></p>
