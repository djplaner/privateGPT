<p><p><a href="http://www.auqa.edu.au">AUQA</a> is coming. Eventually most Australian universities will receive a second visit from AUQA. As such visitations come closer increasing levels of thought are given to demonstrating quality.  What does it mean to demonstrate quality of learning and teaching?</p>
<p>According to Biggs (2001) the answer is<blockquote>The basic question then for QA is: Are our teaching programmes producing the results we say we want in terms of student learning?</blockquote></p>
<p>This definition seems to suggest two main questions to answer:</p>
<ol><li>What do we say we want in terms of student learning?</li><li>How do we know if our teaching programmes are producing those results?</li></ol>
<p>Given what <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/03/06/the-biggest-flaw-in-university-lte-learning-and-how-to-avoid-it/">I've had to say</a> about difficulties associated with measuring the effectivness of learning and teaching, I'm not confident that that the second question can be answered by many universities.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/01/25/somethings-that-are-broken-with-evaluation-of-university-teaching/">level 1 smile sheets</a> do not work what do you do?</p></p>
