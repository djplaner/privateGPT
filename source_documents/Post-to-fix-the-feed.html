<p><p>It appears that <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/04/06/birnbaums-fad-cycle-in-higher-education/">this post</a> and its use of a poll has broken the RSS feed for this blog.  Am hoping that this post will knock that post out of the feed.</p>
<p>Yep, that worked.  Tip: don't use polls in Wordpress.com blogs. They appear to break the RSS feed.</p></p>
