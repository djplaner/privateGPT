<p>This <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=68">blog post</a> by <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/bio.php#hinchcliffe">Dion Hinchcliffe</a> includes a link to the mp3 of talk by <a href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/">Andrew McAfee</a> at a conference.  According to <a href="http://webbizculture.blogspot.com/2006/09/impending-failure-of-standalone.html">another blog</a> Andrew claims to be the guy who coined Enterprise 2.0.

Yet to listen to the talk, but it appears to include much good stuff, however, the blog post does have a lot of important points to consider when thinking about the implementation of Web 2.0 into the enterprise.

Some of the points that resonated with me include
<ul>
  <li> The idea that Enterprise 2.0 is about free form, emergent IT.
 An idea I've been trying to push in the LMS arena, and failing. </li>
  <li> The idea of using the <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/finding_the_real_web_20.htm">PeopleFinder project as an example</a> of high-value emergent use of social software </li>
  <li> The limitations of current enterprise IT provision and the difficulties it creates </li>
  <li> The need to drastically change much of this practice before emergent social software can flourish </li>
  <li> The problem implied by the observation that only a very small percentage of the population actively contributes (e.g. to a site like Wikipedia).  Scaling this down to an enterprise means that the number of contributors is vanishingly small.
An idea taken a bit further, <a href="http://webbizculture.blogspot.com/2006/09/impending-failure-of-standalone.html">here</a>
  </li>
</ul></p>
