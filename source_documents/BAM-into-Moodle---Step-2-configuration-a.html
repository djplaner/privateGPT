<p>Tags: bam, moodle, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>It's Tuesday, so must be time to take the next step in getting <a href="">BAM</a> into <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>. <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/07/16/installing-moodle-first-step-in-bammoodleam/">Last time</a> I got up to having Moodle checked out from CVS and PHP/Apache and MySQL all working nicely together. </p>
<p>This step will need to focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Answering the question, "Should I be using Moodle 1.9.X or 2.0.X to do this development?" </li>
  <li> Getting Moodle configured and working. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Which Moodle version?</h3>

<p>Apparently Moodle 2.0 is coming out soon. My institution is running version 1.9.5. I'm told that there are some changes between the two code-bases. Potentially these changes could mean that I will have to waste time once 2.0 comes out.  Have to spend some time to put some bones on these impressions.</p>

<h4>What is Moodle 2.0 coming out?</h4>

<p>BAM into Moodle has to be completed and operational for T1, 2010 - i.e. Feb 2010. In order for my current institution to move to Moodle 2.0, I would imagine that it would have to be released before the end of 2009....a question to ask.</p>
<p>The Google planning spreadsheet for Moodle 2.0 is listing another 600 days of work to go. Discussion on the developer forums suggest early 2010 as a guess.</p>
<p>At the moment, given this information, I can't see CQU implementing Moodle 2.0 for Feb 2010.</p>

<h4>Moodle Roadmap</h4>

<p>Let's try the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">Moodle Roadmap</a> that should probably have something to say on the issue, or perhaps at least a pointer.  From my quick skim of the roadmap there doesn't seem to be anything that indicates a radical change in how modules/blocks are intergrated or written. Theoretically, this suggests a module developed in 1.9.x should work reasonably well with 2.0. However, some of the APIs that a module might use are changing.  This has implications.</p>

<h4>Go with 1.9.X<h4>

<p>Based on the above, I'm sticking with 1.9.x.  I have, however, asked for some indication from the CQU IT division if they have any insights to share.</p>

<h3>Configuring Moodle</h3>

<p>Back to the <a href="http://dev.moodle.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=28">Intro to Moodle programming course</a> which in turn points to the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle">Moodle installation page</a>.</p>
<p>Have to do some playing around with paths etc to get to XAMPP</p>
<p>It would be interesting for someone with no background in UNIX/source control/Web dev to be installing Moodle.  The docs aren't always really useful, but sufficient if you have the necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually, that's gone surprisingly easy.  All set up.  Need to create a course and a few other bits.  But it's time to pick up the new laptop.</p></p>
