<p>This post is going to be a holding place for a range of resources that will be connected with my fuzzy thoughts around how to establish greater trust and reciprocity (maybe social capital) amongst academics and the staff who support them in developing their teaching.

Tacit knowledge/CoP from <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm05/erm0533.asp">Weigel, 2005</a>
<blockquote>
If higher education is about anything, it must be about the furtherance of knowledge and wisdom, and this requires going beyond the limitations of what Michael Polyani (1966) calls â€œexplicit knowledgeâ€?â€”knowledge that can be readily codified and shared with othersâ€”and venturing into the realm of â€œtacit knowledge,â€? or knowledge that is inherently bound to the experiences, skills, and judgment of a person. Explicit knowledge can be organized in a database or set forth in a document; tacit knowledge must be teased out in the exercise of skills, problem solving, or judgments of an associational or critical nature. Tacit knowledge is mined through conversation, not computers; it is inherently â€œmessy,â€? requiring dialogue, observation, or storytelling to be shared with others (Davenport &amp; Prusak, 1998, pp. 81ff.). It is not insignificant that when the World Bank undertook a major KM initiative, it began by setting up help desks and discussion groups that focused on sharing best practices, instead of attempting to catalog them in a large database (Oâ€™Dell &amp; Grayson, 1998). Moreover, tacit knowledge, because it integrates experience with judgment, has the capability to generate new knowledge.
