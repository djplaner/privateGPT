<h1><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2011/04/07/bim-on-the-back-burner/">BIM on the back burner</a></h1>

<p>Tags: bim, bim2</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to make formal what many people have already assumed. Work on <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM and BIM for Moodle 2.0</a> is not really happening at the moment.  I've already missed the "early 2011" release of BIM for Moodle 2 I was aiming for and have been incredibly slack in solving <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/BIM/issues#issue/33">an issue</a> with BIM for Moodle 1.9 and Yahoo Pipes.

This announcement doesn't mean BIM development will cease, just that it will be delayed somewhat while I complete other tasks. In particular, my current full-time study has to take some priority. Who knows in the absence of guilt about not delivering, I may get back to it sooner rather than later.

My apologies to to anyone that this will negatively impact.

The code is all on github: <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/BIM">BIM for Moodle 1.9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/bimtwo">BIM for Moodle 2.0</a>, people are free to get on with it. Though I'm not sure I'd wish my code on anyone.</p>
