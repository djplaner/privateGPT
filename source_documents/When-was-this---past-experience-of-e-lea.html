<p><p>It's amazing at how perspectives around technology and its use in education don't change. In the presentation on <a href="http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/thinking/">this page</a> I use some quotes from <a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2006/09/what-if.html">the what if presentation</a> by Karl Fisch to outline some previous fearful perspectives on the impact of technology on learning that mirror many of the perspectives held of e-learning.</p>
<p>The following couple of quotes illustrate that the positive perspectives of technology can also be found in history.</p>
<p><blockquote>Both the processing and the uses of information are undergoing an unprecedented technological revolution... This is perhaps nowhere truer than in the field of education. Once can perdict that in a few more years millions of schoolchildren will have access to what Philip of Macedn's son Alexander enjoyed as a royal perogative: the services of a tutor as well-informed and as responsive as Aristotle.</blockquote> -- <a href="http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/">Patrick Suppes</a>, "<a href="http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/articles/comped/67.pdf">The Uses of Computers in Education.</a>" - 1966, Scientific Amercian</p>
<p><blockquote>The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability: and something is bound to come of it.</blockquote>Vannevar Bush, "AS WE MAY THINK",
The Atlantic Monthly, July 1945 </p></p>
