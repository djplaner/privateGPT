In some previous posts (<a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/">the original post</a> and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/">the followup post</a>) I've been playing around using blogs for multiple discussion forums. As yet, no-one else has joined in :(.  Which is not surprising, to some extent, given at least one of the bits of my experiment in the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/">followup post</a> did not work.
</p>
<p>
This post attempts to explain what didn't work and in the process introduce some basics of blogs and discussions as per the Wordpress.com

<h3>Introducing pingbacks</h3>

<p>In the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/">followup post</a> I included a link back to the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/">the original post</a>. What was supposed to happen can be seen on this <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/11/15/expert-designer-another-assumption-ples-question/">unrelated post</a>.  There are a number of responses to the post, including a number that were made using the method I attempted.
</p>
<p>
Wordpress call this method a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pingbacks">pingback</a>. The concept of a pingback expands upon, and at least for some, improves on the idea of a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Trackbacks">trackback</a>.
</p>
<p>
It looks like pingbacks don't work all the time.
