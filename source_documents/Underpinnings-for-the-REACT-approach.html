<p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,2546,en_2649_34539_1900762_119699_1_1_1,00.html">Knowledge Management in the Learning Society</a> is a book from the OECD that examines the issues in and around education due to the changes in society - the learning society.

On skimming through it there is a great deal that could be used to provide some theoretical underpinning for the REACT approach to staff development around learning and teaching
<ul>
  <li> ...the transformation of schools requires that teachers become more collaborative... p74 </li>
  <li> ..which requires a pedagogical transformation that has to be driven by collaborative professional effort rather than by pure research...p74 </li>
  <li> ...not easy given their numbers, but networking could be a key element...p74 </li>
  <li> ...by recognising existing networks, strengthening them and using them more systematically...p75 </li>
  <li> ...transferring knowledge ....requires not just receiving knowledge but transformation and application to the personal situation...p75 </li>
  <li> ...university education focuses on the acquisition of formal, explicit and codified knowledge in special segregated places arising out of formal programs taught be a pedogagicla expert --- apprenticeship learning takes a very different form.  Engineers and Doctors have used the apprenticeship model - but not teaching...theory of situated learning (Lave and Wegner)...p83.....REACT is essentially a CoP/apprenticeship model </li>
</ul>
...and many more.

<blockquote>
This approach not merely rehabilitates the importance of apprenticeship
as a sophisticated form of teaching and learning, but potentially offers a better theoretical basis for many types of learning, especially informal and
incidental learning, which will characterise lifelong learning in knowledge economies
(Fuller and Unwin, 1998; Guile and Young, 1998).
