<p><p>Phillips (2005) includes the following quote<blockquote>In most university subjects, the dominant mode of teaching consists of lectures, tutorials and laboratory practical sessions (Laurillard 2002: 81), with assessment strongly focussed on examinations.</blockquote></p>
<p>This has some connections with some work a colleague and I are doing around <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/18/what-can-history-tell-us-about-e-learning-and-its-future/">what history can tell us about e-learning</a> and some ideas I have about experimenting with the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/09/you-only-get-this-type-of-education-in-class-mythic-attributes-of-the-lecture/">assumptions and/or mythic nature underlying lectures</a>.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>One of the points we're liable to draw from history is that introducing new technology (or a new LMS) into a university is not, by itself, going to change the quality of learning and teaching. Mainly because the conception of learning and teaching held by the academics isn't going to change.</p>
<p>The bit about "assessment strongly focussed on examinations" provides one potential indicator about what those conceptions might be.  i.e. this perspective seems to suggest that<blockquote>focus on examination = indicator of somewhat limited conception of L&amp;T</blockquote>That's a very bald and poor way of putting it, there are all sorts of exemptions and limitations, but that's the crux of it.</p>
<p>So what's the case at our institution? And is there any link between how heavily weight assessment is towards an and how e-learning is used? </p>
<p>In terms of exams, I can determine that for the 2nd major term in 2008 the assessment database I have access to indicates:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 527 courses were offered;<br />This does, I believe, include a number of post-graduate/research courses. This means the percentage of courses with exams might be off - more work needed here.</li>
  <li> 164 of those had an exam; </li>
  <li> the average weighting of that exam of total assessment was just over 54%. </li>
</ul>
<p>Seems to be a particular focus there. I wonder if that focus converts into something observable in the use of e-learning?</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>The major connection with the work on lectures, but also the history stuff, is shown with the following quote from Phillips (2005)<blockquote>Sometimes, ICT has been used to replace face-to-face activities, but, often, this has been an unreflective replication of existing activities (Collis and van der Wende 2002; Harris, Yanosky et al. 2003).</blockquote></p>
<p>I hope the "lecture" work can start to highlight some of those assumptions (which go beyond simply assumptions about learning and teaching to include organisational assumptions).</p>
