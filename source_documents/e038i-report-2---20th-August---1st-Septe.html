<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>This is the second in the fortnightly reports of what I've been doing in my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/elearning-and-innovation/">current position</a> - <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/20/elearning-and-innovation-specialist-report-1-4-20-august/">here's the first</a>. These posts are made just before the meeting with my supervisor. Due to a change in date for the last meeting, this doesn't report on a full fortnight.</p>

<h3>What I said I'd do</h3>

<p>In the last post I planned to be working on the following</p>
<ul>
  <li> Help out on a paper for the indicators project.<br />This took up almost all of the time.  It took up most of last week, a lot longer than I thought. Typical case of under-estimation of effort required.  The paper was completed and submitted to ASCILITE.<p>The work on this paper produced two blog posts: <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/24/identifying-file-distribution-on-webfuse-course-sites/">one</a> and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/28/comparisons-between-lms-the-need-for-system-independence/">two</a>.  The second post summarises some of the findings and identifies a significant hole that has the potential to generate additional papers and funded research and/or development.</p></li>
  <li> Progress BIM.<br />Only limited work on BIM as most of the time was spent on the paper.  Some time was spent also on supporting use of BAM - some detail on this necessary support reported <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/26/e-learning-2-0-and-reliability-of-external-services/">in this blog post</a>. What work was done on developing BIM is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/20/bim5-getting-a-prototype-bim-going/">reported here</a>.  Essentially work has commenced on developing a hard-coded prototype.<p>There have been some nibbles from a program in using BAM to implement the idea of program level e-portfolios.</p></li>
  <li>  Progress the curriculum mapping project/requirement.<br />Little has been done on this one, little potentially can be done on it due to the nature of the problem and local constraints.</li>
 <li> Complete the presentation.<br />Some work has been done on this, but only in terms of refining the argument and improving resources.</li>
  <li>  Make progress on the PhD.<br />Somewhat limited but it is moving forward.  Aiming to have the lit review (chapter 2) completed to first draft stage by the end of next week (may go a little longer).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'll do in the next fortnight</h3>

<p> Current plans are</p>
<ul>
  <li> Work on BIM <br />Still aiming for a prototype at some stage in the next 1 to 3 weeks.</li>
  <li> Research presentation.<br />The presentation has been scheduled for the 22nd September.  Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be spending more time on this.</li>
  <li> Scholarship of L&amp;T.<br />Aim to turn work on the indicators project into some resources to give advice to people wanting to publish. </li>
  <li> Curriculum mapping.<br />Aim to develop a report to submit up the hierarchy.</li>
  <li> Indicators project.<br />Some additional work on this arising out of the thesis and also areas indicated by the paper.  May aim to generate a report on this to submit up the hierarchy.</li>
  <li> PhD<br />Aim to complete chapter 2.<li>
</ul></p>
