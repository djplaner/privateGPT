<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>In <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/09/an-ill-informed-observation-on-connectivism-and-other-learning-theories/">a previous post</a> I made public one of my half-baked ideas about connectivism. This was sparked by a <a href="http://damosworld.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/connectivism-and-the-importance-of-context-an-example/">similar public considerations</a> by a <a href="http://damosworld.wordpress.com/about-damien/">colleague</a>.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://beerc.wordpress.com/">colleague</a> commented on the apparent connections between aspects of connectivism and the work of <a href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/">Dave Snowden</a>.  I agree.  The following is an excerpt from a talk given by Dave Snowden which I think is connected. Take a listen</p>
<p><a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/PatternsSnowdenLion.mp3">We're pattern matching intelligences - Dave Snowden</a></p>
<p>Do you see any connection between what Dave said in connection with the behavioural and cognitive families of learning theories?</p>
<p>My ill-informed interpretation of this is that these families of learning theories are based on a faulty model of human intelligence. </p>
<p>This isn't to say that in certain circumstances with certain tasks and certain people these learning theories may well provide some useful results.  Need to think on this some more.</p></p>
