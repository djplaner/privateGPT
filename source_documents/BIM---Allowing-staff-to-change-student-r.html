<p>Tags: bim, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>BIM is essentially complete and about to go into user testing, however, initial testing suggests that an ability for staff to change the blog students have registered would be a significant benefit during the first couple of weeks.  This post describes the design and implementation of this feature.</p>

<h3>Plan</h3>

<p>The aim is to allow all teaching staff should be able to modify the blog that has been registered for any of their students.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Add to the student details screen, for each registered student, a link "change blog" in the "live blog" - actually change it to "Current blog | Change blog" </li>
  <li> The change blog is a link to a new form, essentially the same as the student register, just ask for a URL. </li>
  <li> When submitted, pass it through the same checks as the student does when registering -- Will need to abstract this code out into a function to use in both places.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Update the student details screen</h3>

<p>Add the change/current blog stuff.  Easy, done.</p>
<p>Need to identify the URL for the form....&amp;screen=ChangeBlogRegistration</p>

<h3>Display the form</h3>

<p>Need to call the function to show the form for both:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Marker</li>
  <li> Coordinator </li>
</ul>
<p>Show the details of the student and the current blog, show a form.</p>

<h3>All done</h3>

<p>All done and working.  Need to update some of the bread crumbs for navigation, but that is part of another task.</p></p>
