<p>I'm late to the last lecture meme. If you don't know what I'm talking about, take some time (76 minutes) out of your life and watch <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/">Randy Pausch's Last Lecture</a> on achieving your childhood dreams.

One of the comments on YouTube suggest that there is nothing new in the lecture. Perhaps, but it's the type of thing we all need to hear from time to time to put a bit of perspective on our own experience and perhaps to spark a rethink.</p>
