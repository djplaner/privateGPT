<p>Tags: thesis</p>

<p>At some stage in the last week I was pointed to <a href="http://www.michaelfullan.ca/home_articles/SeminarPaper204.pdf">this report/paper</a> from Michael Fullan titled "Choosing the wrong drivers for whole system reform". The argument is that the large-scale reforms of K-12 education being undertaken in both the USA and Australia are destined to fail because they have adopted exactly the wrong drivers to encourage system-wide reform that actually improves learning outcomes for all students.

Fullan positions the following as the correct drivers/questions about attempts at whole system reform. The question is, does the attempt at reform
<ul>
  <li> foster intrinsic motivation of teachers and students;</li>
  <li> engage educators and students in continuous improvement of instruction and learning; </li>
  <li> inspire collective or team work; and </li>
  <li> affect all teachers and students - 100 percent?</li>
</ul>

While written for the K-12 sector, I found myself asking these questions about the attempts at reforming learning and teaching I've seen within tertiary education, both at the institutional and sector level.

I wasn't saying "yes" a lot.

In fact, as with Fullan's critique of the US and Oz K12 reforms, I found myself identifying a lot of attempted strategies that actively mitigated against that list of four.

Now I need to read Fullan's work (<a href="http://educhatter.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/the-%E2%80%9Cschool-change%E2%80%9D-wizards-what-drives-michael-fullan-and-his-disciples/">this</a> gives an interesting, alternate perspective on Fullan) a bit more and see what I can critique, but the general themes seem to resonate with me.</p>
