<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas">This presentation</a> by Dave Thomas talks about the Dreyfuss Model of Skill Aquisition and how it applies to software development.  However, the ideas and insights seem to apply to a number of other contexts, in particularly learning and teaching at Universities.  I certainly found a lot of points that resonated.
