<p>Tags: information systems, Uncategorized</p>

<p><a href="http://lyris.isworld.org/isworldlist.htm">ISWorld</a> is a mailing list that acts as a major forum for discussion for information systems academics.  Over the last few days the discussion has been about dropping enrolments and the search for bumper sticker phrases as one way to encourage enrolments.

In one post Neil Ramiller from Portland State University argues the point that IS has a history of starting off new topics that are then adopted/appropriated by other colleagues in the business school.  His examples
<ul>
  <li> Customer relationship management - marketing </li>
  <li> Electronic commerce - marketing </li>
  <li> Knowledge management - management </li>
  <li> Enterprise systems, supply-chain systems - operation management </li>
</ul>

This is one potential argument for attracting students - IS isn't plumbing.  It isn't the boring infrastructure - which is the point of Nick Carr's IT doesn't matter stuff - it's where all the new and interesting ideas in business come from.

Not only does it provide the potential to distance IS from IT and CS.  It also offers an argument for students interested in other business school areas.</p>
