<p><p>A couple of days ago I floated the idea of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/09/03/scaffolding-context-sensitive-conglomerations-in-e-learning-systems/">scaffolding, context-sensitive conglomerations</a> as one idea/model/suggestion for how e-learning systems (currently mostly LMS, but hopefully other models will arise).</p>
<p>George Siemens has <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2010/09/02/light-weight-learning-analytics-tools/">posted about light-weight analytics tools</a> such as <a href="http://research.uow.edu.au/learningnetworks/seeing/snapp/index.html">SNAPP</a>. Both the comments on that post are, to my current somewhat focused/biased perspective, suggestions for the need for scaffolding conglomerations.  Both comments are from practitioners who talk about how the supplement their use of discussion forums with other forms of representation. It would appear obvious that these combinations of tools are useful. I'm pretty sure you could find quite a few talented and motivated academics across the world that are using this combination.  I'm also pretty sure that few of them would be located within the same institution.</p>
<p>Are there any discussion forum tools in e-learning systems that already provide this sort of scaffolding for users? Are there any IT departments in universities that have recognised this need and are helping academics make this connection?</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any, and this suggests to me that there are some fundamental problems with the way these systems are being supported and structured.  i.e. current approaches mean it is unlikely for these sorts of networks of tools/conglomerations to arise.  </p>
<p>SNAPP has used a good approach that makes it simpler to create these conglomerations, through the use of browser plugins. But the advantages of that approach come with a negative.  i.e. I don't believe you can currently generate a SNAPP visualisation for a group of courses (e.g. to see how the students/staff in a program are interacting), or compare visualisations between different courses.  You also can't easily combine SNAPP with other context specific data sources such as student records system etc.</p>
<p>Consequently, SNAPP is a great example of a tool that enables a "scaffolding conglomeration" when combined with an LMS discussion forum.  But it still remains difficult to add the "context-sensitive" component.</p>
<p>I think there's value in exploring how SNAPP and similar tools can be used as both scaffolding and context-sensitive conglomerations, and more importantly, what impact it can have on the practice of teachers, and subsequently the quality of learning.</p>

<h3>Adding advice</h3>

<p>While I remember, there's a next step that I'd like to see a "scaffolding, context-sensitive conglomeration" take.  Advice, examples and connections.</p>
<p>For example, assume I'm teaching a course, I use a discussion forum and I've designed its use for a specific pedagogic purpose.  I've installed SNAPP and to my horror discover a problem.  What do I do? What strategies can I employ to address this problem?  What strategies have other academics in similar (or even different situations) used?  What happened?  Can I get their contact details so I can have a chat?</p>
<p>I would imagine that this addition could also be implemented for students who discovered a "bad" pattern in their own practice.  They could receive advice, examples and connections from other students.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://groups.google.ca/group/learninganalytics">learning analytics group</a> seems to include a leaning towards "intelligent"/"adaptive" software to provide this sort of service.  I'm more interested in how we can use these tools to connect people and provide the scaffolding that enables and encourages them to take some action.</p></p>
