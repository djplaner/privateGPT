<p>Tags: edc3100, teaching</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks off-line, I'm slowly catching up on making public some writing. This post is a follow up to <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/01/20/initial-thoughts-on-an-ict-and-pedagogy-course/">a previous post</a> with some initial thoughts on the ICT and Pedagogy course I'm teaching this term. There were some great comments on that post which I need to think and write about, but later. This post is a collection of some impressions and reactions to the first chapter of the set text for the course.

<h3>Knowing where you are going</h3>

Page 3 of the text leads off with this quote from Forcier and Descy (2002, pp. 15-16) - I've added some emphasis<blockquote>Any lasting changes and reforms will need to be <em>preceded</em> by a vision of what future learning environments will be like. What expectations will be placed on the learner? What will the role of the teacher be? What will the physical structure of the learning environment be?</blockquote>

The book's argument is that "the most exciting use of technology by the students of the future will be an enhanced ability to produce authentic, meaningful work". i.e. what we now know about education (i.e. a constructivist view of learning) provides the vision for lasting changes and reforms.

I have a lot of time for authentic learning, but I am troubled by this idea that we start with a vision of what the future holds. In part it takes me back to the false/pointless argument about whether how technology is used to transform learning and teaching should be driven by the technology or by education. For me this false argument assumes we can know, it assumes that this process of change is knowable. Instead, I prefer Markus and Robey's (1988) view where technology is just one of a number of components of an emergent process of change where the outcomes are indeterminate because they are situationally and dynamically contingent.

Sure, there is some value in informing applications of ICT in education with knowledge of what works in education. But there is also value in critically  exploring new technologies and ways of doing to see what happens. Terms such as emergence, exaptation (Gould, 1991), and bricolage (Ciborra, 1992) spring to mind.

<strong>Implication:</strong> How could a course in ICT and pedagogy effectively marry both perspectives? Having students show how their knowledge of education informs their use of ICT in pedagogy and get them to engage in emergence/bricolage.

<h3>Technochoice and the death spiral of defining definitions</h3>

After a few pages the book does mention its adoption of the technochoice approach suggested by Sachs, Russell and Chataway (1990). An approach which<blockquote>accommodates the process of evolution and continual selection from a spectrum of technological alternatives; the selecting creates tension and leads to opportunities for exploring and experimenting with alternative institutional and organising forms of education</blockquote>
There are good noises about rejecting a linear perspective on process, but in the end the argument is that thinking about ICTs need to be informed by educational rationales. I'm not suggesting that this should be totally removed, but there needs to be some room for uncertainty.

Are our current educational rationales - rationales that evolved in a pre-digital world - the best we can do or will the digital world require the development of new educational rationales/theories? It would appear that the connectivism folk, at least some of them, are arguing this.

Even this early into my career as an University education academic I am finding myself slowly drawn into the "death spiral of defining definitions". i.e. the situation where each education academic has their very own, very nuanced, definition of common terms. The death spiral where 99% of argument is about those individual definitions.

<h3>Linear stage models, incremental and radical innovation, and complexity</h3>

Having briefly claimed some problems with "linear", the book then seems to  reference a lot of models that are linear. e.g. Newhouse, Clarkson and Trinidad's (2005) "Stages of teacher development", a five stage model
<ol>
  <li> Inaction - no interest in using ICTs in pedagogy. </li>
  <li> Investigation - initial actions arising from an interest in using ICTs in pedagogy. </li>
  <li> Application - regular, competent, and confident use of ICTs in pedagogy. </li>
  <li> Integration - ICT in pedagogy has become critical to learning. </li>
  <li> Transformation - teacher takes on leadership roles around ICTs in pedagogy and knowledgeably reflects on its integration. </li>
</ol>

Using something as simple and linear as this to explain something as complex as figuring out how to use ICTs in your L&amp;T always gives me pause.

<h3>Barriers to ICT integration</h3>

First, the question of what ICT curriculum integration is presented as problematic. Then a list of barriers is given apparently from Shelly et al
(2004)
<ul>
  <li> Lack of teacher training and professional development. </li>
  <li> Lack of curriculum, technical and administration support. </li>
  <li> Limited time for teacher planning. </li>
  <li> The difficulty of computer access. </li>
  <li> Budget constraints. </li>
  <li> Resistance to change by many educators. </li>
</ul>

The course I'm teaching can really only hope to address two of these, the  first and last. With the last being somewhat questionable.

For student teachers - based on my own experience - I would guess that limited planning time would be the major problem. A student teacher is still developing their knowledge of the content and pedagogy they need to use and struggling with time to harness this. Add in technology....

The solution to all this is proposed as strategic planning. I don't believe that strategic planning within the confines of an existing formal education system is sufficient for the type of transformative change people are talking about. The nature of the people responsible for strategic planning are not likely to have the mindsets ready for such change.

<h3>The need for authentic experience</h3>

The first chapter closes with an interview with Michelle Williams an experience ICT teacher and teacher education. Michelle also happens to be one of the USQ TTF folk working on this course. The interview closes with an important point that resonated with me.<blockquote>Teachers who do not have opportunities to use smart and complex digital systems and networks do not see the imperative to duplicate these information and workflow processes in curriculum tasks. They are unlikely to believe such processes are authentic because they are not aware of their  existence, let alone have experienced how such processes and thinking change work practices, and community and society culture.</blockquote>

Increasingly I have a desire for this course to provide student teachers with that experience. However, I hestitate somewhat at the thought that the  standard University LMS could be claimed as providing experience with using "smart and complex digital systems and networks".

I'm currently wondering about this sort of structure for the course
<ol>
  <li> Spend the first week or two or three running the course fairly traditionally with a focus on students thinking about whether their experience with ICTs
in their Unviersity study and their own prac teaching is transformative or not. </li>
  <li> Use increasingly different approaches as the term progresses to illustrate what might be considered transformative. Initially have some of this connected with "lessons plans". i.e. change the course via mechanisms they are expected to use in teaching. </li>
  <li> By the end the students have been led to use of a variety of technologies
targetted at producing something different. i.e. it's the students job to use ICTs to design something transformative around ICTs and pedagogy.  Probably aim to keep this fairly broad and open, but require demonstration of significant use of
"smart and complex digital systems and networks" and the production of
some public output/contribution. </li>
</ol>

In essence, the underlying aim is to provide an environment in which student teachers can become, or at least make progress toward becoming, digital residents through applying the theories and technologies to their own experience studying this course and teaching in schools.
