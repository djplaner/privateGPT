<p>Tags: intuitionFail</p>

<p>For some reason I'm in a fairly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian">contrarian</a> frame of mind tonight. So starting a series of blog posts listing and criticising widely held positions in education seems like the thing to do. I'm sure you have your favourite example, feel free to add them to the comments. Also feel free to add pointers to resources - both for and against - the examples.

The spark for the idea comes <a href="http://elearnmag.acm.org/archive.cfm?aid=2070611">from this article</a> title "Why Is the Research on Learning Styles Still Being Dismissed by Some Learning Leaders and Practitioners?" from the ACM eLearn Magazine. The article argues that (one of) the reason(s) where the idea of learning styles are still widely given credence within education is because they appeal to intuition and common sense. The idea resonates with people and hence it is hard to convince them of the alternate view.

I'm pretty sure learning styles aren't the only example of this problem within the field of education. Given that I'm taking up a role as a teacher educator in the new year, it seems a good time to start adding to my list. The following starts with my initial list and I plan to expand on these over the coming weeks. (There's a connection between this idea and the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> I included in the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/the-missing-ps-lessons-for-the-adoption-and-implementation-of-learning-management-systems">initial Ps Framework presentation</a> - start on slide 154.)

<h3>The initial list</h3>

I haven't bothered to define what it meant by "failure of intuition", that would only prematurely close off discussion. I'm happy to live with messiness.

So, my initial list:
<ol>
  <li> Learning styles. <br />Steve Wheeler calls learning styles <a href="http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.com/2011/11/convenient-untruth.html">A convenient untruth<a> and points to a range of additional resources arguing against learning styles. Including a <a href="http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/September-October%202010/the-myth-of-learning-full.html">2010 article from Change</a> that argues for three reasons why learning styles continue to be accepted:<ol><li> Broader claims (e.g. all learners are different) with which learning styles connect are true.</li><li> Learning styles suggest that everyone has strengths, it's egalitarian, which much be good.</li><li> Learning styles have become common knowledge. </li></ol> </li>
  <li> The learning pyramid.<br /> The most visited post on my blog is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/10/11/the-learning-pyramid-true-false-hoax-or-myth/">this one</a> that argues that the learning pyramid has no support whatsoever from research. The comments on this post are symptomatic of the intuition/common sense problem. The commenters - including some apparent "gurus" on the education publication/conference circuit - argue for the learning pyramid because it just makes sense to them. This is especially problematic because - as argued by <a href="http://www.karenhume.ca/learning-pyramid/">this post</a> (I've just read the comments on this post, I recommend them, but that could just be my own confirmation bias) - the learning pyramid resonates with constructivist theories of learning, which as everyone knows must be good.
<p>
Will Thalheimer has a <a href="http://www.willatworklearning.com/2006/05/people_remember.html">blog post</a> critical of the learning pyramid and associated ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li> People are rational. <br />This isn't specific to education, most other professions assume that people are rationale. Especially when they are in a management role (or from the IT division). This list is based on the idea that people are not rational decision makers. We do not actively search through all the evidence, weight that evidence and make objective decisions. We are pattern matching intelligences, when evidence matches our established patterns, we select for it. </li>
  <li> Leadership.<br /> Earlier this week <a href="http://deangroom.wordpress.com/">Dean Groom</a> tweeted a link to <a href="http://cepm.uoregon.edu/pdf/whatweknow103.pdf">"What we know about successful school leadership"</a> from the American Educational Research Association (AERA). It starts with the following<blockquote>Scratch the surface of an excellent school and you are likely to find an excellent principal. Peer into a failing school and you will find weak leadership.</blockquote> 20 years experience in university (yes, it is only anecdotal evidence) suggests that such a causal link between "good" leaders and organisational performance (good or otherwise) is questionable. But this belief in the importance of leadership to outcomes seems to be a key part of the teleological myth underlying much or modern organisational practice.<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=p9alf-JZFQ8C&amp;dq=gabriele+lakomski+management+without+leadership&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Managing without leadership: Towards a theory of organizational function</a> argues against the causal link and attempts to develop "a causal, bottom-up account of organizational practice, in place of top-down theories of leadership".</li>
  <li> Digital native and immigrants. <br />This one is fairly obvious.</li>
</ol>

So, what other examples of intuition failure exist in the discipline of education?</p>
