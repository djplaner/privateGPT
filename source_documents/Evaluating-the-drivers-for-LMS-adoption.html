<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p>Coates, James and Baldwin (2005) identify/propose 5 drivers behind the adoption of LMS
<ol>
  <li> Means of increasing the efficiency of teaching </li>
  <li> Promise of enriched student learning </li>
  <li> The drive of new student expectations </li>
  <li> Competitive pressure between institutions </li>
  <li> A response to massive and increasing demands for greater access to higher education </li>
  <li> A culture shift towards the control and regulation of teaching </li>
</ol>

The questions around these include
<ul>
  <li> How many, if any, institutions have stated these explicitly? </li>
  <li> Have they attempt any sort of evaluation about how well their choice and implementation have achieved those goals? </li>
  <li> Can we evaluate the current crop of LMS and their ability to respond to those drivers? </li>
</ul>

The last point is potentially the most interesting.  Some initial thoughts
<ul>
  <li> Do current LMS really provide the facilities that enable an institution to control and regulate teaching?  How many actually use this facility?
  </li>
  <li> Do current LMS really provide scope to improve T&amp;L, provide greater access, or reduce costs? </li>
</ul>

In a <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/219/302">recent survey</a> of <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a> staff we found the following somewhat relevant results
<ul>
  <li> Enriched student learning/improved teaching and learning <br />
        When asked if adoption of Blackboard would assist CQU become a flexible learning leader (one of its strategic aims) responses included
         <ul>
            <li> 56% of staff didn't know if this was the case </li>
            <li> 25% thought it unlikely </li>
            <li> 17% thought it likely </li>
         </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Control and regulation of teaching <br />
         Which organisational unit should be responsible for quality of the LMS
         <ul>
            <li> 61% the relevant faculty
            </li>
            <li> 27% division of teaching and learning services </li>
            <li> 12% information technology division </li>
         </ul>
          "Do you believe that implementing Blackboard is a way to place additional controls on teaching and learning activities at CQU?"
         <ul>
             <li> 44.5% yes </li>
             <li> 13.3% no </li>
             <li> 10% no response </li>
             <li> 32.3% no difference </li>
         </ul>
  </li>
</ul></p>
