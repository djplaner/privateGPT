<h3>About the poll</h3>
The poll is a semi-serious attempt to gather the perceptions of how people perceive organisational digital technologies. The idea (and the text from the two poll options) comes from <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/what-if-our-digital-technologies-were-protean-implications-for-computational-thinking-learning-and-teaching/">this conference paper.</a> The presentation will be on Friday 30th September with additional presentation resources coming to this blog soon.</p>
