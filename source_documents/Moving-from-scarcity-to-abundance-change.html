<p><p>Growing up in <a href="http://www.rockhamptoninfo.com/">Rockhampton</a> in the 70s and 80s, access to music that wasn't pop or C&amp;W just didn't happen.  Different types of music were scarce.  In these days of iTunes, peer-to-peer etc. it has radically changed. There is an abundance.</p>
<p>The impact of this change is difficult to underestimate, and difficult to illustrate.  This YouTube video and what it embodies does a really good job.</p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/11/music-youtube-generation/">This post</a> has more about it.  This is the core of it for my point<blockquote>Israeli musician Kutiman has taken hundreds of YouTube samples - often non-musical ones - and turned them into an album that’s awesome on so many levels that it leaves you stunned. First of all, the music is good; really good, especially if you’re a fan of Ninja Tune’s catalog. Secondly, it’s amazing to see all those unrelated YouTube bits and pieces fit together so perfectly</blockquote></p>

<h3>The question is...</h3>

<p>The same migration from scarcity to abundance is happening in learning and teaching and e-learning at universities.  How is the practice of those tasks going to change?</p></p>
