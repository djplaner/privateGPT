<p>Tags: bam, bim, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>In a couple of weeks I'm off to Canberra to talk PhD, potential ALTC grants and promote the use of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a>. As part of the latter task, I'm giving a quick talk at the University of Canberra as part of their <a href="http://www.canberra.edu.au/tlc/current-events">Stuff the works lunches</a>. The title of the talk is "Reducing the aggravation of student blogging: The story of BIM".</p>
<p>I have to send of a short abstract for the talk today, so thought I'd share it here.  I'll use this post as the home for all the resources associated with the talk.  The slides should be up sometime just before the talk and I hope some audio/video will follow not long after.</p>
<p>The basic aim of the talk is to share the why, what and how of using individual student blogs in teaching. The premise is that there is value in using individual blogs, but that it can require a bit of work and that BIM can help.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>There are many good reasons (reflection and meta-cognition, reducing transactional distance, increasing sense of ownership and community, ICT literacy etc) to encourage or require students to use individual blogs as part of their learning. However, the use of individual student blogs is not without its problems, which include: limited quality of LMS blogging tools, difficulties of managing externally hosted blogs, the question of how to mark and comment on student posts, the novelty of blogging for many students and staff, increased workload etc.</p>
<p>This session will tell the story of BIM (BAM into Moodle). A Moodle module designed to reduce the aggravations of supporting individual student blogging. Since 2006 BIM, and its predecessor BAM, have been used to support 2800+ students in 26+ course offerings creating 20,000+ blog posts. The session will show how BIM works and describe one approach to why and how it was used in one course. It will include discussion of the challenges and benefits of using BIM.</p>

<h3>Slides</h3>

<p>The slides that will probably be used in the talk are below.  If things go well, I'll have some audio/video of the talk up in the next day or so.</p>
