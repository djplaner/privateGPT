<p>It's been an intellectually draining few days with a range of visitors to the institution talking about a range of different topics. It started on Monday with George Siemens giving a talk titled "The future of the University: Learning in distributed networks" (video and audio from the talk <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/learnteach/learnres/vsarchive/2013/siemens">available here</a>). A key point - at least one I remember - was that the structure of universities follows the structure of information and the current trend is toward distributed networks. On Tuesday, Mark Drechsler ran a session on <a href="http://www.moodlemoot.org.au/mod/book/view.php?id=24&amp;chapterid=8">Extending Moodle using LTI</a> which raises some interesting questions about how the LMS mindset will handle the challenge of a distributed network mindset.

<h3>LMS != distributed network</h3>

The LMS is an integrated, enterprise system sourced from a single vendor. The institution as a whole decides upon which of the different available systems it will choose and then implements it on a server. The students and staff of that institution must now make use of that system. Changes to that system are controlled by a governance structure that may/may not approve the addition or removal of functionality into the enterprise system. Only a designated IT group (outsourced or local) are actually able to make the change. The "network" has a single node.

The typical mindset encouraged by an LMS when designing learning is not what is the best way to engage student learning. It's the best way to engage student learning within the constraints of the functionality currently provided by the LMS. I wrote more about the limitations of this model in <a href="https://djon.es/blog/publications/the-life-and-death-of-webfuse-principles-for-learning-and-leading-into-the-future/">Jones (2012)</a> and almost incessantly over the last few years. Chapter 2 of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">PhD thesis</a> a fair bit of this argument.

Over recent years most institutions have realised that a single node network consisting of the LMS isn't sufficient for their needs. The network has had a few new nodes such as a lecture capture system, a content repository, an eportfolio system and a range of others. However, this "network" of services isn't really a distributed network in that it's still only the institution approved processes that can add to the network. I as an academic, or one of my students, can't decide we'd like to add a service that is integrated into this institutional network.

Sure we can use standard hyperlinks to link off to Google docs or any one of the huge array of external services that are out there. An extreme example is my <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/06/10/the-kludge-for-marking-learning-journals/">kludge</a> for using BIM this year. Where I'm hosting a version of BIM on my laptop because for various reasons (including many of my own making) BIM couldn't get installed into the institutional version of Moodle in time.

The trouble is that these kludges are not members of the distributed learning systems network associated with the institution. The most obvious indicator of this is the amount of manual work I need to engage in to get information about students from the institutional system into my local install of BIM and then to get information out of my local install of BIM back into the institutional ecosystem.

To have seamless integration into the institutional LMS network requires going through the institutional governance structure. Now there are good reasons for this, but many of them arise from the problem of the LMS not being a network. Some examples include
<ul>
  <li> a "bad" addition to the LMS could bring the system down for everyone;<p>If the LMS were a network, then this wouldn't happen.  The additions would be on another node so that if the addition was "bad" only that node would be impacted. If nodes could be added by individuals, then only that individual's applications would be impacted.</p> </li>
  <li> not enough people are going to use the addition;<p>To make it worthwhile to integrate something into the system, there has to be the likelihood that a large number of people are going to use it. Otherwise it's not worth the effort. The cost of adding something to an integrated system is high. With a network approach the cost of adding a new feature should be low enough to make it economical for only one person to use it. </p>
  <li> who's going to help people use the new addition;<p>Since a large number of people have to be able to use the system, this raises the question of who is going to support those people. In a network approach, there isn't this need. In fact, I may decide I don't want other academics using the service I've added.</p> </li>
  <li> the inertia problem;<p>The other major impact of this high cost of integrating a tool into the LMS is inertia. The cost of making changes and the cost of negative impacts means great care must be taken with changes. This means that rapid on-going improvement is difficult leading to inertia. Small-scale improvements suffer from a starvation problem.</p>
  <li> the trust problem;<p>Since it's a high cost, high risk situation then only a very limited group of people (i.e. central IT) are allowed to make changes and only after approval of another limited group of people (the governance folk).</p>
  <li> vanilla implementation.<p>All of the above leads to vanilla implementations. It's too difficult to manage the above, so let's implement the system as is. I've heard stories of institutions moving away from more flexible systems (e.g. Moodle) back toward more constrained commercial systems because it removes what element of choice there is. If there's no choice, then there's no need for complex discussions. It's easier to be vanilla.</p>
</ul>

<h3>The LTI Challenge</h3>

The <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm">Learning Tools Interoperability standard</a>, or more precisely it's integration into various LMS offer a challenge to this LMS mindset. LTI offers the possibility - at least for some - of turning all this into more of a network than an integrated system. The following will illustrate what I mean. What I wonder, is how well will the existing governance structures around institutional LMS - with their non distributed network mindset - respond to this possibility?

Will they
<ol>
  <li> Recognise it as a significant advantage and engage in exploring how they can effectively encourage and support this shift? </li>
  <li> Shut it down because it doesn't match the LMS mindset? </li>
</ol>

<strong>BIM and LTI</strong>

In the very near future, BIM will be installed into the institutional Moodle install for use by others. I have always feared this step because - due to the reasons expressed above - once BIM is installed I will not be able to modify it quickly.

LTI apparently offers a solution to this via this approach
<ol>
  <li> I set up a version of Moodle on one of the freely available hosted services.<p>This would be my install of Moodle, equivalent to what I run on my laptop. No-one else would rely on this version. I could make changes to it without effecting anyone. It's a separate node in the network relied upon by my course. I can install a version of BIM on it and modify it to my hearts content confident that no-one else will be impacted by changes.</p> </li>
  <li> Install the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/LTI_Provider">Moodle LTI Provider module</a> on my version of Moodle. </li>
  <li> Set up a course on my version of Moodle, create a BIM activity and add it to the LTI provider module.<p>This allows any other LTI enabled system to connect to and use this BIM activity as if it were running within that system, when it is actually running on my version of Moodle. Of course, this is only possible when they have the appropriate URL and secret.</p> </li>
  <li> Go to the institutional version of Moodle and the course in which my students are enrolled and add an "External Tool" (the Moodle name for an LTI consumer) that connects to BIM running on my version of Moodle.<p>From the student (and other staff) perspective, using this version of BIM would essentially look the same as using the version of BIM on the institutional Moodle.</p> </li>
</ol>

LTI allows the institutional LMS become a network. A network that I can add nodes to which are actually part of the network in terms of sharing information easily. It's a network where I control the node I added, meaning it no longer suffers from the constraints of the institutional LMS.

<h3>The downsides and the likely institutional response</h3>

This is not an approach currently in the reach of many academics. It's not an approach required by many academics. But, that's the beauty of a network over an integrated system, you don't need to be constrained by the lowest common denominator. Different requirements can be addressed differently.

In terms of technical support, there would be none. i.e. you couldn't expect the institutional helpdesk to be able to help diagnose problems with my Moodle install. I would have to take on the role of troubleshooting and ensure that the students, if they have problems, aren't asking the helpdesk.

Perhaps more difficult are questions around student data. I got in trouble last year for using a Google spreadsheet to organise students into groups due to students entering their information onto a system not owned by the institution (even though the student email system is outsourced to Google). I imagine having some student information within a BIM activity on an externally hosted server that hasn't been officially vetted and approved by the institution would be seen as problematic.  In fact, I seem to recollect a suggestion that we should not be using any old Web 2.0 tool in our teaching without clearing it first with the institutional IT folk.

Which brings me back to the my questions above, will the organisational folk
<ol>
  <li> Recognise the LTI-enabled network capability as a significant advantage and engage in exploring how they can effectively encourage and support this shift?
  </li>
  <li> Shut LTI down (or at least restrict it) because it doesn't match the LMS mindset?<p>How long before the LTI consumer module in the institutional LMS is turned off?</p> </li>
</ol>

<p>LTI seems to continue what I see as the inexorable trend to a more networked approach, or as framed earlier as enabling the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/04/06/why-learning-management-systems-will-probably-go-away/">best of breed approach</a> to developing these systems. LTI enables the loose coupling of systems.  Interesting times ahead.</p>
