<p>Tags: Uncategorized, website</p>

<p><p><strong>Update:</strong> The old server that I used to use for my website and also to implement the rotating banner on this blog, is down.  It will likely to be down for quite some time.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/10/16/the-great-website-move-of-2008/">moved by website</a> from my long-term personal server to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> the one bit of functionality that I lost was the rotating banner image.
</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/175187603/" title="Kaikoura Ocean Range Sunrise by David T Jones, on Flickr"><img align="left" alt="Kaikoura Ocean Range Sunrise" height="180" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/63/175187603_d3b17a5487_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>
<p>
The image of the sunrise just north of Kaikoura in the banner above is static.  It's always the same. Back on the original website I had a collection of 40+ images that, thanks to a small perl script, would cycle through each one. As of late 2008 you can still see this in action on <a href="http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Reading/">this page</a> - just hit the refresh button to see the banner image change.

I'd like recreate this effect on this site. But I have to do it without server side scripting and I should also probably do it to maximise the benefits of Web 2.0.  I've got some ideas about how to do this using <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Pipes</a> and JSON or similar.  These ideas will have to be reality tested.  However, the first thing I should do is check to see what others have already done.
</p>
<p>
Ahh, it appears that there is the need to pay for a CSS customisation to enable this. 4 cents a day paid via PayPal. The <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/random-image-header-tutorial?replies=22#post-36298">approach outlined here</a> and requires a server somewhere that will allow you to upload a PHP script.  Essentially the approach I was using on my original server.
</p>
<p>
Not very Web 2.0.  Will experiment with Flickr and Pipes, do a bit more searching.  Can do some testing without requiring the CSS customisation upgrade.
