<p>Tags: Chapter 2, design theory, elearning, quotes, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>Given my pre-occupation with the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/phd-thesis/">thesis</a>, which involves the formulation of a design theory for e-learning. It's of little surprise that I have an interest in the theory, practice and e-learning.  Came across the following quote this morning in checking some literature, and I like it - new quote for a thesis chapter.<blockquote>Theory without practice leads to an empty idealism, and action without philosophical reflection leads to mindless activism. â€“ Elias &amp; Merriam, 1980, p. 4</blockquote></p>
<p>Currently this quote speaks to me because I observe the practice of e-learning within universities being performed with zero philosophical reflection.</p>
<p>The quote is the lead in to an article that is talked about <a href="http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/2008/05/26/kanuka-article-tech-philosophy-in-practice/">here</a> and more recently <a href="http://damosworld.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/philosophies-of-technology-technological-determinism/">here</a></p>
