<p>Tags: thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>In mid to late October 2008 I moved my long-term personal website to this blog, the early story is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/10/16/the-great-website-move-of-2008/">told here</a>. One of my concerns voiced in that <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2008/10/16/the-great-website-move-of-2008/">original post</a> was to maintain by Google ranking.  Here's an update.
</p>
<p>
The first "problem" is the way that Google provides search results. Depending which country you are in the ranking will be different. When I originally reported that my personal website was #7 in a google for "david jones" this was based on a search from within Australia.  I didn't test what other countries saw, though I believe it was fairly high.
</p>
<p>
This is somewhat of a problem for comparison purposes as my new site is hosted by <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> which, from a quick search that found nothing and a large assumption is located in the US.  Update: The US assumption is correct - data centers in Dallas, San Francisco and San Antonio. Given the different locations, doing a direct comparison might be somewhat questionable.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=david+jones">Searching from within Australia</a> this blog comes up as result 177 for "david jones". From a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=david+jones&amp;gl=US">US-based search</a> it comes up as number 12.
