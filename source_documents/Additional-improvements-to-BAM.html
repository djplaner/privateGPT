<p>Tags: bam, Uncategorized</p>

<p>It's almost the end of term.  We've started marking the blogs using BAM and not surprisingly some rough edges are showing.  Things to look at
<ul>
  <li> Merging feeds
Currently BAM simply copies over the local mirror of the feed with the new one.  This causes problems because Wordpress, and likely other providers, only provide a feed with the last 10 posts.  The solution would be to merge the new feeds with the local mirrored copy.  XML::Feed, the Perl module used in BAM, offers the splice method to do this.  So should be easy.
  </li>
  <li> Making copy detection, pro-active
I find it hard to believe but we have had students who have copied the blog entries of other students.  At least half a dozen.  Now that it is written, need to have this run as a more regular event and notify students as soon as it happens.
  </li>
  <li> Increase visibility to students
The students don't really see anything from CQU's end.  This causes problems in terms of whether they've completed the questions etc.  Implement a view and email notification system that gives the student a visible view of CQU's summary of where they are up to. Notify students when the miss certain events.
  </li>
  <li> Remove the special characters
Students tend to cut and paste their posts from Word.  This introduces special characters which, after the blog has finished with them, can cause problems.
</ul></p>
