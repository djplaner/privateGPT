<h2>Abstract</h2>
Digital technology is increasingly a pervasive presence in contemporary society. The knowledge and skills required to utilise digital technologies are increasingly seen as necessary for both individuals and organisations, if they wish to become successful participants in and contributors to society. For the individuals and organisations involved in education there is a growing expectation that they are not only required to help learners develop the necessary digital technology knowledge and skills, but that they have the knowledge and skills to effectively use digital technology to fulfill that requirement. Recent history suggests that many individuals and institutions involved in education are struggling to fulfill this expectation (Bigum, 2012; Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, &amp; Freeman, 2015; Masters, 2016; Mcleod &amp; Carabott, 2016; OECD, 2015; Willingham, 2016).

There are numerous factors that contribute toward these on-going struggles. However, this talk will propose that ignorance of and the subsequent failure to harness the true nature of digital technology is a significant, under-examined, and in some cases deemed an unimportant factor (Kirschner, 2015). Drawing on a range of literature (Kay, 1984; Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; Papert, 1993; Yoo, Boland, Lyytinen, &amp; Majchrzak, 2012; Yoo, Henfridsson, &amp; Lyytinen, 2010) this talk will develop a model for understanding the fundamental properties and unique affordances of digital technology. The talk will illustrate how this model can be used to identify and understand significant shortcomings with existing practice and research at all levels of education. Lastly, the talk will use the model to map out potentially, fruitful areas of future research around questions such as:
<ul>
	<li>Why will growing up using digital technology everyday never be sufficient to make you a digital native?</li>
	<li>Why might <a href="http://www.sunjournal.com/news/lewiston-auburn/2016/05/19/state-offering-schools-ipad-trade/1927446">88.5% of teachers and 74% of students in Auburn,</a> Maine prefer laptops over iPads, and what might that say about the value of tablets as computing devices?</li>
	<li>Why is the Moodle assignment activity so hard to use in my course and why does the provided documentation not help?</li>
	<li>What's next after the Learning Management System?</li>
	<li>Why is the current push to embed the teaching of coding in primary schools likely to fail and what might be done about it?</li>
	<li>How might an educational institution leverage the fundamental properties and unique affordances of digital technology to be "<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/about-usq/about-us/plans-reports/strategic-plan">a leader in physical and digital higher education learning experiences geared to a diverse student constituency</a>"?</li>
</ul>
