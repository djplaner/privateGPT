<p><p>The following basically tells the rationale and approach used to create a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast">(audio) podcast</a> of the presentations from the <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/blogs/ples/">Personal Learning Environments &amp; Personal Learning Networks Online symposium on learning-centric technology</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone else has already done this, but just in case will share.</p>
<p>If you don't want to be bored by the background, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast">this is the link for the podcast</a>.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>I've hated the idea of the LMS for quite some time. I even had the chance to briefly <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni">lead a project</a> looking at investigating how PLEs could be grown and used within a university, at least before the organisational restructure came.  In its short life the project produced <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Symposium_on_Personal_Learning_Environments_2008">a symposium</a>, a number of publications, various presentations and a little bit of software.</p>
<p>Due to the background I had some significant interest in the <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/blogs/ples/">symposium</a> being organised by <a href="http://www.connectivism.ca/">George Siemens</a> and <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a>. However, due to other responsibilities, odd times (given my geographical location) for the elluminate presentations and the low speed of my home Internet connection I knew I was unlikely to actively engage.  Some of these factors have already prevented my on-going engagement with CCK09.</p>
<p>I probably would have left it there, however, over the last 24 hours two separate folk have mentioned the symposium and almost/sort of guilted me into following up.   The one thing I can do at the moment, due to a fitness kick involving a great deal of walking, is listen to mp3s. So, I wanted an easy way to get the mp3s. A podcast sounds ideal for my current practices. </p>

<h3>The podcast</h3>

<p>Last night I did a quick google and <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/CCK09_Recordings">found this page</a> that seems to provide a collection of links to video and audio recordings of presentations associated with the <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/connectivism/">CCK09 course</a>.  Including some mp3s from the presentations at the PLEs &amp; PLNs symposium</p>
<p>Rather than download and play silly buggers with iTunes I decided to recreate an approach we used on our <a href="http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/EDED11448/">first "Web 2.0 course site"</a>. Using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> the students and staff in the course could tag audio/video for inclusion in a podcast created by <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>.  </p>
<p>So I followed the same process for these:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Tagged the mp3 files linked to <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/CCK09_Recordings">from this page</a> with del.icio.us using a <a href="http://delicious.com/davidj1/pleplnPodcast">"pleplnPodcast" tag</a></li>
  <li> Used feedburner to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast">create the podcast</a> </li>
  <li> Subscribed via iTunes, this podcast is now part of all the other podcasts I follow. </li>
  <li> Synced with the iPhone and I'm away. </li>
</ul>
<p>I just hope now that I have the time to reflect and write about what I listen to.</p>
<p>Thank you Deidre and Maijann for the encouragement to engage with the symposium.  Thanks to those organising the symposium and CCK09 for the resources.</p></p>
