<p>Tags: eei</p>

<p><p>Feel free to play around with the following h5p interactive (one of the examples provided on the <a href="http://h5p.org/">h5p site</a>).  I'm testing out if and how it tracks people's engagement with the interactive. What does it do when someone who doesn't have an account on this blog (and/or doesn't login) interacts? What data can I see?</p>

<p>By default it appears that h5p/wordpress doesn't really provide anything useful and a quick search didn't reveal any possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.olivertacke.de/labs/2018/03/25/collecting-and-analyzing-data-with-h5p-and-opening-up-education-maybe/">This post</a> provides a bit more detail on broader possibilites with xAPI and h5p, including <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5pxapikatchu/#installation">this Wordpress plugin (h5pxAPIkatchu)</a>. This plugin catches all the xAPI statements emitted by h5p interactives and stores them in the Wordpress database for downloading for analysis.</p>
