<p><div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>I'm biased, for other reasons I'm in the process of becoming a high school teacher of information technology/maths. That said, it's given me the opportunity to think about a problem from a previous live as a University academic in information systems/information technology.<br />
<br />
That problem was that, apart from a small period of time around the dot-com boom, the type of students enrolling in these courses was very limited, primarily nerds. This wasn't a problem because of the students, some very fine people within that group. It's a problem for Uni IT/IS courses because this group represents only a very small percentage of the population and when enrolment numbers are tanking you worry about this.<br />
<br />
The continual response from the University I worked at was to change the program, to make it more attractive. They never seemed to get the fact that by the end of high school, the majority of students have already made their up their mind about IT/IS because of their experiences. And they sure as hell aren't signing up to do that for the rest of their life.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to this quote from an article explaining how on University CS instructor has made his course more interesting by allowing students to work on something meaningful to them. And the quote from someone in the NSF saying that they have the high school CS course to get kids interested, but can't get it in schools.<br />
<br />
This seems to be shaping as the challenge for me in coming years, how to get a program like this into a high school and observe what it does.</p></div></div><div class=""><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603757_2.html" rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603757_2.html">www.washingtonpost.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote cite="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603757_2.html" class="Amp_Content_Item"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div class="TxtCntnt">"We'll have no problem interesting kids in doing these things," Cuny said.
