<p>Tags: thesis</p>

<p>Based on my experience in Australian universities I would like to suggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype">four archetypes</a> that are destroying the quality of learning in higher education. They are, in order of arrival at universities:
<ol>
  <li> Idiot academics. </li>
  <li> "Strategic" leadership. </li>
  <li> Blinkered project managers. </li>
  <li> Quality nazis. </li>
</ol>

This is not to suggest that all academics, leaders or project managers fit into the above archetypes. I do think, however, that the trend within the higher education system is to increase the proportion of these archetypes.

I would also argue that the last three are often seen as necessary because of the "idiot" academic. In fact, the "idiot" academic is the known enemy of the other three. Over time the other three archetypes see the "idiot" academic as the enemy and can end up treating all academics as idiots. This failure to differentiate is a major problem.

<h3>Idiot academic</h3>

This is the lady or gent who doesn't respond to student queries. Is obviously ill-prepared for classes. Regularly returns assignments weeks after they should have been returned (if at all). Is still using the same content and assessment from 10+ years ago. e.g. are teaching a computer hardware course using Intel 8086 chips. It's the type of academic who complains about over-work but is about to commence their 2nd hour of the morning in the staff room and hasn't produced a journal paper for the last 5 years (if ever) and probably bemoans the quality of teaching of those who do research.

It's the type of academic that should have been shown the door years ago if universities had anything approaching appropriate human resource management processes.

The quality of learning and teaching is not important for these folk, they wouldn't know it if it bit them on the hind quarters.

<h3>Strategic leadership</h3>

10 or 15 years ago universities tended only to hire Vice-Chancellors as strategic leaders/saviours. i.e. they were given 5 year contracts, money and responsibility to "make things happen". Which gave rise to the standard KPIs that went something like this
<ul>
  <li> End Year 1 - have replace University senior executive with my mates. </li>
  <li> End Year 2 - have implemented flagship projects (e.g. 5 term year, international campuses, partnerships with an employment firm or publisher). </li>
  <li> End Year 3 - start spruiking how effective the flagship projects had been. </li>
  <li> End Year 4 - start looking for a VC's job at a better university. </li>
  <li> End Year 5 - Move on before the waste product hits the cooling device. </li>
</ul>

This trend has slowly moved down the hierarchy to Deans of Faculties and most recently to Heads (now known as Deans) of Schools.

By definition these folk can't grapple with or understand complex contextual factors. They have to get on with their flagship projects.

The quality of learning and teaching is not important for these folk, successful completion of flagship projects is.

<h3>Blinkered project managers</h3>

These folk are also usually on contracts, specifically to get a project done. Strategic leadership needs them because the leader can't actually do the implementation. That would take time away from looking for the next job.

A blinkered project manager doesn't care about anything except the successful completion of the project. In fact, a truly blinkered project manager doesn't even care if the project was a success, as long as they can claim it was a success in public.  And since the strategic leader who was "leading" the project also needs it to be a success, they are almost certainly going to have a success.

e.g. a LMS implementation where the LMS is unavailable for the first 2 weeks of go live because the database configuration couldn't handle the load. This after a term of testing and numerous indications that it wasn't working.  Is still considered a great success.

The quality of learning and teaching is not important for these folk, successful completion of flagship projects is.

<h3>Quality nazis</h3>

The second cousin of the blinkered project manager. Teaching and learning in modern higher education is complex. There are problems (see idiot academics above) and mistakes. The obvious way to prevent these from happening is to have quality assurance processes, checklists, templates, forms, and systems. Since it is obvious if idiot academics spent hours more completing these checklists, templates, processes, forms, and systems to prove that they did what they didn't do in the first place, the problems won't happen.

The quality of learning and teaching is not important for these folk, successful ticking of the boxes is.</p>
