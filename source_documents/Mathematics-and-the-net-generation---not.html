<p>Tags: mathematics, teaching</p>

<p>So, in a few weeks time I'll be teaching mathematics to high school kids. Almost certainly grades 8 &amp; 9 (find out next week).  I've been doing a bit of reading and have joined various online groups. Last week I purchased a couple of textbooks used in local schools to refresh my knowledge and see what's being covered.

As it happens I started looking in the textbook for ideas for a video. <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2011/04/07/group-2-technologies-images-audio-and-video/">In this post</a> I was playing with <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?category_name=what-can-you-do-with-this">What can you do with this (WCYDWT) idea</a> from <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com">Dan Meyer</a>.  That's when I came across this problem
<blockquote>Ying has five 90-minute cassettes that have been partly filled with recordings</blockquote>

I'll stop there, I'm trying to imagine explaining to a 13 year old kid that doesn't see the relevance of mathematics what a cassette is. I was a late adopter of CDs, and I don't think I was buying cassettes after 1995. a 13yo will have been born in 1997/1998.

The "net generation" and "they think differently due to technology" has been getting a run in the some of the courses we're taking. It seems that message hasn't gotten through to the textbook folk.

Though, I do have to admit, that coming up with a textbook's worth of authentic exercises and examples that can be fit within the constraints of a commercial textbook, is not a challenge I want to take on anytime soon.

Two questions down, there is a similar question, but this time it's a 3-hour videotape.</p>
