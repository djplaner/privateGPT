<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>As mentioned <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/21/phd-update-15-some-progress-and-an-absence/">a fortnight ago</a> I've had much of the last two weeks doing non-PhD stuff including a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/tags/longreach/">road trip to Longreach</a>.  So this update is somewhat light on.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/21/phd-update-15-some-progress-and-an-absence/">Last update</a> I said I would by now have:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Made some progress on the People component of the Ps Framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>To some extent that's been done.  I have a structure and I have completed a draft of the <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/29/students-and-e-learning-a-start-to-the-people-section/">first major section on Students</a>. That draft includes an overview of what I think the structure for the People component will be.</p>
<p>I've spent today wondering the literature gathering perspectives on some of the other sections. I have sufficient information on this stuff, I need to write it up.  That's next week's job.</p>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>There's a trend developing here with weekends. Next weekend I'll be off celebrating a couple of anniversary related events in Adelaide.  This means Friday through Tuesday will be lost to the PhD.  </p>
<p>In this case, I aim to have another update on the Thursday before I leave. The main aim from now until then will be to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Make as much progress as possible on the People component.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm hoping to have at least 2 or 3 days writing.</p></p>
