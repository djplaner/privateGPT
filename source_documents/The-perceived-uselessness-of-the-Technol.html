<h2>Abstract</h2>

In a newspaper article (Laxon, 2013), Professor Mark Brown described e-learning as<blockquote>a bit like teenage sex. Everyone says they're doing it but not many people are and those that are doing it are doing it very poorly.</blockquote>

This is not a new problem with a long litany of publications spread over decades bemoaning the limited adoption of new technology-based pedagogical practices (e-learning). The dominant theoretical model used in research seeking to understand the adoption decisions of both staff and students has been the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Šumak, Heričko, &amp; Pušnik, 2011).  TAM views an individual's intention to adopt a particular digital technology as being most heavily influenced by two factors: perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. This presentation will explore and illustrate the perceived uselessness of TAM for understanding and responding to e-learning's "teenage sex" problem using the BAD/SET mindsets (Jones &amp; Clark, 2014) and experience from four years of teaching large, e-learning "rich" courses. The presentation will also seek to offer initial suggestions and ideas for addressing e-learning's "teenage sex" problem.
