<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>This is the first of the updates to be sent out on a Sunday.  Part of a plan to move from doing this on Friday to Sunday.  Mostly because there have been a couple of Friday's I've missed.  Also, this might set the reflection up as the start to a week, rather then the end and consequently encourage greater emphasis on moving forward than looking back...who knows.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/05/phd-update-13-back-after-a-week-off/">last week</a> progress has been slowed by another two days lost due to public holiday and other work commitments. So, I'm not happy with progress. </p>
<p>I'm increasingly motivated to get on with this, but translating into action...</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p>I said last week that I would</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete the process component.</li>
   <li> Make significant progress on the People component.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've achieved neither of those.</p>
<p>I have completed two small sections of the process component and posted them to the blog</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/08/university-processes-management-and-planning/">Management and planning</a> processes within universities </li>
  <li> <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/06/11/institutional-learning-and-teaching-strategies/">Institutional learning and teaching strategies</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>To complete the Process section my current plan calls for me to complete three more sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Institutional e-learning - I've made some progress on this. Will try to finish this within the next day or so. </li>
  <li> Learning and teaching - this will be small. </li>
  <li> Lessons from process - I have most of the points I want to make and references. </li>
</ol>

<h3>What I'll do next week</h3>

<p>Keep it simple and repetitive.  I'll try and</p>
<ul>
  <li> Complete the process component.</li>
   <li> Make significant progress on the People component.</li>
</ul></p>
