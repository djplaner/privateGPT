<p><p>This is the first post in my new "quotes" section. Acting as a storage place for all the interesting insights I come across. </p>
<p>I came across this one as part of the <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2008/03/18/site-2008-keynote/">keynote presentation</a> given by <a href="http://mkoehler.educ.msu.edu/blog/">Mat Koehler</a> and <a href="http://punya.educ.msu.edu/">Punya Mishra</a> at the SITE'2008 conference.</p>
<p>They quote it as being from Plato's Phaedrus<blockquote>[Writing] will implant forgetfulness in their souls... <em>calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks</em>...[students will] seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom</blockquote></p>

<p>This illustrates the fear and the actual loss of something as the world moved from an oral to a written culture. For me it highlights that there will always be fear around the potential implications of a new technology. It also really highlights that people can be limited by their in-built and unquestioned assumptions that have been formed by their environment and can find it difficult to evaluate the positives of the new in some sort of objective way.</p>
