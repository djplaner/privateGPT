<p>Tags: react, react2008, Uncategorized</p>

<p>We're about to embark on a little experiment in the scholarship of learning and teaching going under the tag react2008.  The fundamental aim is to help improve the quality of papers we will write that are targeted for publication at <a href="http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/default.htm">EdMedia'2009</a>. The experiment is going by the names of either react2008 or writers' workshop.  The project as a <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Writers_Workshop">central website</a>.

Other aims of the project include
<ul>
  <li> Helping some of the less experienced researchers develop some insight into one way of developing and writing papers - of performing research. </li>
  <li> Help the participants gain some appreciation of the differences of perspective within the group and how those differences compliment each other. </li>
  <li> Increasing the quantity and quality of research outputs of <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/">CDDU</a> and the <a href="http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni">PLEs@CQUni project</a>. </li>
</ul>

This post is intended to give a brief description of how the whole thing might work.

Subsequent posts will start talking about implementation issues and what's next.  After that each of the steps will be expanded and tasks allocated.

<h3>Principles and Background</h3>

The ideas underpinning this exercise is much informed by the <a href="http://sleid.cqu.edu.au/REACT/">Reflection, Evaluation and Collaboration in Teaching (REACT) project</a>.  The react2008 project will have a very different aim and process, however, it will be based on/informed by many of the same principles and <a href="http://sleid.cqu.edu.au/REACT/foundations.htm">foundations</a> of the original REACT process.

In particular, react2008 will draw on the ideas of Shulman (1993) around the scholarship of L&amp;T, in particular, the importance of
<ul>
  <li> Communication and community<br />
          react2008 will use face-to-face discussions and social network software to create a community of researchers who will have to communicate with each other about their process of writing and research.
  </li>
  <li> Creation of an artifact <br />
         react2008 participants are creating a paper as their final artifact.  There will also be other artifacts produced along the way in terms of wiki pages and presentations.
  </li>
  <li> Peer review<br />
         A key part of the react2008 process is that there will be peer review throughout the process of the discussion and artifacts produced by the participants.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How will it work</h3>

react2008 will use a simple process with a small number of steps as the framework through which people will develop, implement and write about their research idea.  There is no claims made that this is the only process, the best process, a sequential process or broadly suitable to all people.

However, there is a claim that it is a fairly generic process that provides enough structure to provide participants with a common language to talk about their process and enough freedom to do their own thing in terms of process and research perspective.  Usefulness is seen as more important than ideological adherence.

Most steps in the process will require the production of an artifact and the submission of that artifact to a semi-structured peer-review process. The participants will be expected to both produce their artifacts and comment on the artifacts of others. The artifacts and the communication/review will be primarily done through blogs and wiki.

The current suggested list of steps is summarised below.  A later post will expand in more detail on these steps.

The steps are:
<ol>
  <li> What's the problem problem? What's the question?<br />The aim of research is, in this context, always seen as an attempt to solve a problem or answer a question.  The first step is to develop a statement about what the research problem or question is about. (remember this isn't a sequential process, this step will be revisited numerous times).
   </li>
  <li> What type of knowledge are you going to contribute? <br />This work assumes that there are different types of knowledge (of theory) produced in research. Depending on the type of knowledge you wish to generate/contribute you will use different types of method.  </li>
  <li> How are you going to develop that knowledge? <br /> You have to use some sort of appropriate process to develop the knowledge you want to write about.  There are multiple choices, you need to be clear about what process and why you will be using. </li>
  <li> How does this knowledge add to and fit with existing knowledge? <br />It's important that you know how this knowledge you will generate fits with existing knowledge in the area. You need to be able to explain why it is valuable.
   </li>
  <li> What do you need to do to make it fit with the outlet? <br /> Different publication outlets have different perspectives and difference approaches are required to get accepted. You need to become familiar with the outlet. </li>
  <li> Do the work. <br />At this stage you need to generate the knowledge.</li>
  <li> Give a presentation. <br />Once you've generated the knowledge you need to begin work on presenting it to folk in some sort of finished form. A presentation will precede writing of the paper.</li>
  <li> Write the paper. <br /> The actual process of turning the knowledge into an appropriate form for the publication outlet. </li>
  <li> Respond to reviewer comments. <br />An art form in itself.</li>
  <li> Present the paper. <br />If we're talking about a conference, then another presentation is required to further refine the initial presentation.</li>
</ol></p>
