<p>As a developer, you have to love it when someone using your code diagnoses and identifies their own problem with your code. Especially if they give you a clear and concise explanation you can use. That's what happened with <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/02/27/diagnosing-a-bim-problem/">the BIM2 problem</a> I blogged about recently. It appears I was using Moodle 2.3.4 the problem was found on Moodle 2.3.2+ and there was a change in the Moodle code in-between. The following describes the bug and hopefully the fix/change I've made to the BIM code.

<h3>The problem</h3>

The problem arises in bim/marker/allocation_form.php with this
[source code="php"]
       // turn off the checking
        $mform-&gt;disable_form_change_checker();
[/source]

disable_form_change_checker is <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/lib/formslib.php_Form_Definition#disable_form_change_checker">described here</a> and it was added in <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_2.3.3_release_notes">Moodle 2.3.3</a>.

So the question is how to handle this neatly so that BIM gracefully degrades with older versions of Moodle?

<h3>The solution?</h3>

One approach is to simply require the more recent version of Moodle, but given this is one function call in one section of the code. There has to be a more fine grain solution, doesn't there?

Perhaps just removing the call? But I remember it getting quite annoying without it. So, for now, it stays.

Of course, method_exists.  I need to code more.

[source code="php"]
        if ( method_exists( $mform, "disable_form_change_checker" ) ) {
            $mform-&gt;disable_form_change_checker();
        }
[/source]

No problem with 2.4.  What about older versions?

Yes, Moodle 2.2 crashes with this problem in BIM. And method_exists fixes it.  Time to commit the code and we're done.</p>
