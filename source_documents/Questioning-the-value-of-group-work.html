<p>Tags: Uncategorized</p>

<p>For a number of the educators I know group work is a magical solution the promises great improvement to the effectiveness of their courses.

Personally, I've always had a problem.  Since the mid-1990s I've believed that most of the probles I see with group work comes from the need for there to be inter-dependence between the members of the group.  That is the performance of each member of the group is intertwined with the performance/contribution of other members of the group.  Get in a group full of experts and you'll perform well, get a group of dunces...

So the thought was, if you could get collaboration without the inter-dependence you might avoid the problems and have generate some other benefits.

From the brevity of that it's not hard to see I didn't spend a lot of time on it.

Over the last week or so there has been a range of resources circulating that question the value of group work including:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20060901/column-freedman.html">What's Next: The Idiocy of Crowds</a> - a magazine article slagging off at the wisdom of crowds stuff.  Some interesting points but appears to be going to far the other way.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.teachandlearn.ca/blog/2006/10/03/to-ungroup-a-class/">To ungroup a class</a> - a blog post from the blog of proximal development reflecting on the value or otherwise of his preference not to engage his students in group work
  </li>
  <li> And last, but no means least, <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> recent growing meme comparing <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4126240905912531540&amp;hl=en">groups and networks</a>
  </li>
</ul></p>
