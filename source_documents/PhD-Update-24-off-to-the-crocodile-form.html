<p><p>Another early update today - off to the Crocodile Farm as an excursion <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3891084465/">with the boys</a> so today's a write off.  However, progress has been good and the end is nigh for chapter 2 - at least in first draft.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>

<p>The aim for this week was to complete the pedagogy component.  The component will have three sections: <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/09/07/pedagogy-the-centrality-of-the-pedagogue-and-what-they-believe/">The centrality of the pedagogue</a> (done); Learning theories, research and advice for pedagogues (about half done); and Lessons from Pedagogy for e-learning (most of the ideas in place - these are generally quick to get done).</p>

<h3>What I'll do in the next week</h3>

<p>Two main aims for next week:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Complete the pedagogy section and get Chapter 2 all together. </li>
  <li> Get started on chapter 5. </li>
</ol></p>
