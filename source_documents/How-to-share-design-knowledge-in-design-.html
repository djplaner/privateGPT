<p>Using Blackboard Learn to design and manage a quality learning environment is hard. Managing the web content alone is <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2019/01/30/improving-reuse-of-design-knowledge-in-a-lms/">hard to do well</a>. To do so requires significant HTML, CSS and related web design knowledge. Knowledge that not everyone has, or should have, or can have. That's why there are so many ugly Blackboard sites.

The difficulty of sharing this specific type of design knowledge is just one small example of the question facing institutions of higher education (especially in these pandemic times): How to share design knowledge in design for digital learning?

The following resources are associated with an <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/">ASCILITE'2019 paper</a> (or <a href="https://2019conference.ascilite.org/assets/proceedings/ASCILITE-2019-Proceedings-Final.pdf">conference proceedings PDF</a>) that attempted to explain one possible way of answering that question. 

Not <em>the</em> answer, but an answer that has since been successfully used to share design knowledge across hundreds of courses across multiple institutions (but mostly at my current institution).

Early versions of the work are described in blog posts (<a href="https://djon.es/blog/2019/01/30/improving-reuse-of-design-knowledge-in-a-lms/">Card Interface</a> and <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2019/02/24/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning/">Content Interface</a>) and are currently (mid-2021) open source software ready to use on any Blackboard Learn instance (<a href="https://djplaner.github.io/Card-Interface-Tweak/">Card Interface</a> or <a href="https://djplaner.github.io/Content-Interface-Tweak/">Content Interface</a>)
<h3>Working Software</h3>

This paper draws on the experience developing the Card and Content Interface. Two collections of Javascript & CSS that can be embedded into any instance of Blackboard Learn. 

The Card Interface is simplest to install and use and has been used at Universities in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.

Both tools have

<h3>Abstract</h3>
Higher education is being challenged to improve the quality of learning and teaching while at the same time dealing with challenges such as reduced funding and increasing complexity. Design for learning has been proposed as one way to address this challenge, but a question remains around how to sustainably harness all the diverse knowledge required for effective design for digital learning. This paper proposes some initial design principles embodied in the idea of Context-Appropriate Scaffolding Assemblages (CASA) as one potential answer. These principles arose out of prior theory and work, contemporary digital learning practices and the early cycles of an Action Design Research process that developed two digital ensemble artefacts for 7 courses (units, subjects) and in less than a year been used in over 60 sites. Experience with this approach suggests it can successfully increase the level of design knowledge embedded in digital learning experiences, identify and address shortcomings with current practice, and have a positive impact on the quality of the learning environment.
