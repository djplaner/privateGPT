<p>For a variety of reasons I returned to giving a lecture today.  Here's a quick reflection and thoughts where I might go next.

<h3>Why?</h3>

As originally <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/02/10/how-to-replace-the-lecture/">explained here</a> I wanted to move away from the idea of a lecture. And I <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/02/19/designing-the-weekly-ramble/">have implemented the ramble idea</a> and used it as a basis for lectures/tutorials last week.

However, the pull of the lecture is great. So, I gave into temptation and gave a lecture. Sitting here now, I am wondering why I did this to myself and the students.  The first part of the lecture was your typical diatribe and done badly. Little or no engagement from the students and achieved little more than consuming some time.

I did get to use the lecture capture facility on-campus, which seemed to work okay. Of course, given the latter part of the lecture was focused on students doing individual or group work, I'm not sure the recording approach works well.  I probably should cut bits out of the video. Though it does appear that the quality of the recording is quite low.

As to deciding what I'll do next week, am going to wait for feedback from students, but current preference would be not to record a lecture like this again, focus on students doing activities based on the ramble.

Especially when some of the activities done in the subsequent tutorial generated much more engagement and took things in really interesting ways.
