<p>Tags: Uncategorized, web 2.0 course sites</p>

<p>One of the problems with arguing a "Web 2.0 course site" to many academics is the fact that the content is open.  This is still incredibly troubling to a large percentage of academics (must find out how prevalent).

One, not very strong, argument against this feeling is demonstrating the amount of free material already available.  Such as <a href="http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/2006/06/free-computer-science-video-lecture_24.html">this list of computer science video lectures</a>.

It's actually a <a href="http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/">blog for free science, video lectures</a> and includes similar for mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.

<b>Other courses</b>

Harvard Law has a course <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cyberone/">Cyberone</a> that is making use of a range of different net technologies and has much of the course open.
