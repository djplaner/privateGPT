<p><a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/sydney06/proceeding/html_abstracts/85.html">Goold and Auga (2006)</a> describe an experiment in prototyping of a transformation of a face-to-face course into an online offering.

This looks like an interesting template to use in trying out the Web 2.0 Course Site idea.  The process would be something like
<ul>
  <li> Identify an existing course website or two </li>
  <li> Figure out how to convert them to a Web 2.0 course site <br />
        Which in itself encapsulates a range of interesting trade-offs.  Do a purely technical translation? Aim for something more transformative?
  </li>
  <li> Grab a collection of students and staff to trial it out </li>
  <li> Use the feedback to return to step 2.
</ul></p>
