<p>After seeing a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/05/31/changes-in-links-between-student-posts/">previous post</a> sharing some of his visualisations of the links between blog posts of EDC3100 students, Nick provided some video showing how the links were made over time.

When I have some time it will be interesting to explore how events within the course (e.g. feedback on assignment 1 etc) impacted the connections between students.

Also interesting to explore why even at day 77 there are a couple of outliers not connected with the others.</p>
