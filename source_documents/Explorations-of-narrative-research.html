<p>Tags: elearning, narrative, research</p>

<p>For a long time I've had a vague interest in narrative research, i.e. it's one of those things I always meant to learn more about.  Here are some initial explorations.

<h3>Narrative approaches to education research</h3>

My google for "narrative research method education" turns up <a href="http://www.edu.plymouth.ac.uk/resined/narrative/narrativehome.htm">this site</a> from the UK as the #1 hit.  I'll start there.

Connects strongly with me from the start due to this "Human beings are storying creatures. We make sense of the world and the things that happen to us by constructing narratives to explain and interpret events both to ourselves and to other people."

Dave Snowden often uses the label Homo Narrans as an alternate label for the species. These folks have an academic reference for something similar<blockquote>Indeed, somewhat playfully, it has been suggested that there is a case for revising the term homo sapiens to ‘homo fabulans – the tellers and interpreters of narrative’ (Currie, 1998: 2).</blockquote>

Lots of discussion here, particular liked this<blockquote>Bruner has suggested that there are two basic ways in which human beings think about, make sense of, and tell about the world: narrative cognition and logico-scientific paradigmatic cognition (Bruner, 1986). Essentially, logico-scientific cognition is concerned with universals, empiricist reasoning and proof: and narrative cognition, with how the particular and specific contribute to the whole.</blockquote>Especially the last point about the "particular and specific" have contributions to make for the whole.

Richardson's (2000) criteria for evaluating narrative papers
<ul>
  <li> Substantive contribution. </li>
  <li> Aesthetic merit. </li>
  <li> Reflexivity and participatory ethics. </li>
  <li> Impact. </li>
  <li> Experience - near </li>
</ul>

Deluze and rhizomes get a mention for a number of things, including structure.

List of narrative approaches
<ul>
  <li> Autoethnography. </li>
  <li> Ethnographic fiction </li>
  <li> Poetry. </li>
  <li> Performance ethnography. </li>
  <li> Mixed genres. </li>
  <li> Writing as a method of inquiry. </li>
  <li> Narrative interviewing. </li>
</ul>

It would appear that autoethnography is approach currently most appropriate.  Resources to follow up with include

<h3>Autoethnography</h3>

So let's explore this little thread a bit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoethnography">Wikipedia</a> is about as good a place as any to start.

Apparently I'm leaning towards analytic authoethnography, rather than evocative authoethnography, as per Ellingson and Ellis (2008, p 445) - as quoted on Wikipedia<blockquote>Analytic autoethnographers focus on developing theoretical explanations of broader social phenomena, whereas evocative autoethnographers focus on narrative presentations that open up conversations and evoke emotional responses.</blockquote>But perhaps not, in some other literature there appears to be some disquiet about the rationale of analytics autoethnography.

This captures an aspect/perspective interesting to me (again from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoethnography">Wikipedia</a>)<blockquote>According to Bochner and Ellis (2006), an autoethnographer is “first and foremost a communicator and a storyteller.” In other words, autoethnography “depicts people struggling to overcome adversity” and shows “people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles” (p. 111). </blockquote>
