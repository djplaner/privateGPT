<p>I'm part of a group that's trying to take a deep dive into our courses using "learning analytics". My contribution is largely the technology side of it and its time to generate some pretty pictures.  The following is a summary of some playing around with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and ended up with some success with Plot.ly.
<h3>Example - box plots</h3>
Toe in the water time, can I get an example working. Start with <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061502">box plots</a> as I've got some data that could fit with that.

Rough process should be something like.
<ol>
	<li>Set up some space on the local web server.</li>
	<li>Install the library.</li>
	<li>Get the example working.</li>
	<li>Modify the example for my data</li>
</ol>
Step #4 is a bit harder given that I don't yet grok the d3 model.
<h3>Work through some tutorials</h3>
Starting with <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/">bar charts</a>.

So some jQuery like basics: selections, selectors, method chaining.

Appears <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">joins</a> might be the most challenging of the concepts.

data space (domain) -&gt; display space (range)

Mmm, d3.js is too low level for current needs.
<h3>Plot.ly</h3>
<a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">Plot.ly</a> is an online service driven by a Javascript library that is built upon d3.js and other services. Appears to be at the level I'd like.  Example works nicely.

Does appear to be a big project.

Ohh nice.  The example looks very appropriate.

Bit of data wrangling and the following is produced.

Even that simple little test reveals some interesting little tidbits. Exploring a bit further should be even more interesting.</p>
