<p>Tags: bim, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>It is with a significant sense of relief that I announce the release of version 1.0 alpha of <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a>.  You can see the code and what passes for documentation <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/current-version-of-bim/">on this page</a>.  The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">main BIM page</a> gives more background on the rationale and design of BIM.</p>
<p>BIM is meant to be used in action by 5 courses at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQUniversity</a> in the term starting next week.  Before that happens, it is being given the once over by the folk at <a href="http://netspot.com.au/">Netspot</a>. Shall be interesting to see what they find, BIM is my first real taste of Moodle development and it probably shows.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that BIM 1.0alpha will become BIM 1.0 before the week is out.</p>

<h3>What next</h3>

<p>The rest of this week I'll be producing various resources to help the students and staff of the 5 courses using BIM.  These will be freely available.</p>
<p>At some stage in the next week, I'm hoping to start the process of contributing the BIM code to the broader Moodle community.</p>
<p>After than, I hope to get into some reflection on the process and get a <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2010/02/06/challenges-in-developing-innovative-pedagogy-in-blended-learning-the-case-of-bim/">paper ready for submission</a> to <a href="http://moodlemoot.org.au/">MoodleMoot AU 2010</a>.</p>
<p>At some stage, the various ideas that have not made it into v1.0 will have to thought through.</p>
<p>More immediately, it's time for some rest and relaxation.</p></p>
