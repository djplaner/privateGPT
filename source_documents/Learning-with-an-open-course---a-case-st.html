<p><p>It seems the open educational resources and open courses are one of the next big fads. I realise that they've been around for a long time. There is the  formalisation of open courses arising out of the MIT and similar projects leading to the <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org/">OCW consortium</a> and more recently there's been idea of a <a href="http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE%2BReview/EDUCAUSEReviewMagazineVolume45/ThroughtheOpenDoorOpenCoursesa/209320">MOOC idea</a> arising from work by Seimens, Cormier, Downes and others. Even before all that there were various ad hoc examples of open courses (of different types) made available through the work of various "lone rangers".  The fad cycle around OER/OCW has been in an upswing for a while, lots of formal institutional interest and increasingly there are grants being awarded. In fact, it appears that including OER/OCW in a grant title seems to be a good thing at the moment.  Sure sign of a fad? </p>

<h3>Personal aside</h3>

<p>I was one of those lone rangers way back in the mid-1990s with the courses in systems administration and operating systems I designed and taught at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQU</a>. The websites for these courses were open to everyone. As part of that openness, I made archives  of the Systems Administration course available for download and was happy for folk to put up mirrors of the site. An interesting side effect of this practice is that while I can no longer find any record of those course sites on institutional servers, I can find the mirrors of the courses <a href="http://snap.nlc.dcccd.edu/learn/djones/85321/index.html">elsewhere</a>.  Sadly though, most of the links seem to be broken and pointing to the wrong place.  Well that was a copy of the course site from 2000. In trying to find a better mirror I came across <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7944#comment-13914">this nice comment</a>.  You can still find the study guide/book from the course <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6525167/Introduction-to-linux-system-administration">online</a>.</p>

<h3>Eat your own dog food</h3>

<p>I'm always skeptical of "movements" when the fad cycle has kicked in an institutions start making them part of their "strategic" plans. So, I've been wondering how good some of the institutional open courses are and whether there might be some insight gained from using one of the courses as a basis for learning. In my case, it's a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_your_own_dog_food">eating your own dog food</a>. As someone who pushes for courses to be open, perhaps I should try them more as a student.</p>
<p>Now I have started (but not completed) some of the Downes/Siemens MOOCs and will probably try and connect with their <a href="http://connect.downes.ca/how.htm">next one around PLEs/PLNs</a>. In this case, I'm more interested in the open courses that are probably better termed open content.  e.g. the MIT courses where the content is available, but there really is no instructor or cohort doing the course with you. What's it like working through one of those courses on your own?</p>
<p>I've been pondering this for a while, then last weekend, I came across <a href="https://oli.web.cmu.edu/jcourse/lms/students/syllabus.do?section=fc32b54080020c690121302510376c6a">this course</a> on "Empirical Research Methods"</a> from CMU. It just so happens that this is one of my weaknesses. So, working through this course seems a good way to kill two birds with one stone.  </p>
<p>Once the thesis is more complete, I plan to work through this course and use the blog to reflect on the experience and what I experience and what learn.</p></p>
