<p>Tags: bim, design theory, distributedcognition, edc3100, elearning, indicators</p>

<p>Came across Perrotta et al (2013) in my morning random ramblings through my PLN and was particular struck by this<blockquote>a rising awareness of a gap between 'state of art' experimental studies on learning and technology and the 'state of the actual' (Selwyn, 2011), that is, the messy realities of schooling where compromise, pragmatism and politics take centre stage, and where the technological transformation promised by enthusiasts over the last three decades failed to materialize. (pp. 261-262)</blockquote>

For my own selfish reasons (i.e. I have work within the "state of the actual") my research interests are in understanding and figuring out how to improve the "state of the actual". My <a href="http://moodlemoot.org.au/mod/book/view.php?id=24&amp;chapterid=56">Moodlemoot'AU 2013 presentation</a> next week is an attempt to establish the rationale and map out one set of interventions I'm hoping to undertake. This post is about an attempt to make explicit some on-going thinking about this and related work. In particular, I'm trying to come up with a research project to document the "state of the actual" with the aim of trying to figure out how to intervene, but also, hopefully, to inform policy makers.

Some questions I need to think about
<ol type="a">
  <li> What literature do I need to look at that documents the reality of working with current generation university information systems? </li>
  <li> What's a good research method - especially data capture - to get the detail of the state of the actual? </li>
</ol>

<h3>Why this is important</h3>

A few observations can and have been made about the quality of institutional learning and teaching, especially university e-learning. These are
<ol>
  <li> It's not that good.
        <p>This is the core problem.  It needs to be better. </p>
  </li>
  <li> The current practices being adopted to remedy these problems aren't working.
        <p>Doing more of the same isn't going to fix this problem. It's time to look elsewhere. </p>
  </li>
  <li> The workload for teaching staff is high and increasing.
       <p>This is my personal problem, but I also think it's indicative of a broader issue. i.e. much of the current practices aimed at improving quality assume a "blame the teacher" approach. Sure there are some pretty poor academics, but the most of the teachers I know are trying the best they can.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>My proposition</h3>

<strong>Good TPACK == Good learning and teaching</strong>

Good quality learning and teaching requires good TPACK - Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge. The quote I use in the abstract for the Moodlemoot presentation offers a good summary (emphasis added)<blockquote>Quality teaching requires developing a <em>nuanced</em> understanding of the <em>complex relationships</em> between technology, content, and pedagogy, and using this understanding to develop appropriate, <em>context-specific</em> strategies and representations. Productive technology integration in teaching needs to <em>consider all three issues</em> not in isolation, but rather <em>within the complex relationships in the system defined by the three key elements</em>. (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006, p. 1029)</blockquote>

For some people the above is obvious. You can't have quality teaching without a nuanced and context specific understanding of the complex relationships between technology, pedagogy and context. Beyond this simple statement there are a lot of different perspectives on the nature of this understanding, the nature of the three components and their relationships. For now, I'm not getting engaged in those. Instead, I'm simply arguing that <blockquote>the better the quality of the TPACK, then the better the quality of the learning and teaching</blockquote>

<strong>Knowledge is not found (just) in the teacher</strong>

The current organisational responses to improving the quality of learning and teaching is almost entirely focused on increasing the level of TPACK held by the teacher. This is done by a variety of means
<ol>
  <li> Require formal teaching qualifications for all teachers.<p>Because obviously, if you have a teaching qualification then you have better TPACK and the quality of your teaching will be better. Which is obviously way the online courses taught by folk from the Education disciplines are the best.  </li>
  <li> Running training sessions introducing new tools. </li>
  <li> "Scaffolding" staff by requiring them to follow minimum standards and other policies. </li>
</ol>

This is where I quote Loveless (2011)<blockquote>Our theoretical understandings of pedagogy have developed beyond Shulman’s early characteristics of teacher knowledge as static and located in the individual. They now incorporate understandings of the construction of knowledge through distributed cognition, design, interaction, integration, context, complexity, dialogue, conversation, concepts and relationships. (p. 304)</blockquote>

<strong>Better tools == Better TPACK == Better quality learning and teaching</strong>

TPACK isn't just found in the head of the academic.  It's found in the tools, the interaction etc they engage in.  The problem that interests me is that the quality of the tools etc found in the "state of the actual" within university e-learning is incredibly bad. Especially in terms of helping the generation of TPACK.

Norman (1993) argues "that technology can make us smart" (p. 3) through our ability to create artifacts that expand our capabilities. Due, however, to the "machine-centered view of the design of machines and, for that matter, the understanding of people" (Norman, 1993, p. 9) our artifacts, rather than aiding cognition, "more often interferes and confuses than aids and clarifies" (p. 9). Without appropriately designed artifacts "human beings perform poorly or cannot perform at all" (Dickelman, 1995, p. 24). Norman (1993) identifies the long history of tool/artifact making amongst human beings and suggests that<blockquote>The technology of artifacts is essential for the growth in human knowledge and mental capabilities (p. 5)</blockquote>

<h3>Documenting the "state of the actual"</h3>

So, one of the questions I'm interested in is just how well are the current artifacts being used in institutional e-learning helping "the growth in human knowledge and mental capabilities"?

For a long time, I've talked with a range of people about a research project that would aim to capture the experiences of those at the coal face to answer this question.  The hoops I am having to currently jump through in trying to bring together a raft of disparate information systems to finalise results for 300+ students has really got me thinking about this process.

As a first step, I'm thinking I'll take the time to document this process. Not to mention my next task which is the creation/modification of three course sites for the courses I'm teaching next semester.  The combination of both these tasks at the same time could be quite revealing.
