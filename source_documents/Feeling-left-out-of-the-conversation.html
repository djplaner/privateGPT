<p><a href="http://muzedujourney.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/the-ups-and-downs/comment-page-1/#comment-9">In a comment</a> on <a href="http://muzedujourney.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/the-ups-and-downs/">this post</a> about the ups and downs participants are going through in the NGL course Mari shares the struggles of being offline in this type of a course. The feeling where being offline feels a bit like you've left the conversation and have fallen behind the evolution of where the others are up to.

I'm wondering whether is something inherent in a NGL course, or whether it's a combination of a bunch of other stuff.

<h3>Learn to love the ignorance</h3>

I wonder how much of this is similar to <a href="http://futurelearningmusings.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/me-as-a-student/">Elisha's worry</a> about keeping "up to date with the latest educational trends and research".  In an NGL world can you know everything or keep up with all the conversations?  Should you even try?  Should you instead do what works for you, maintain and build your connections to others, and use those connections in ways useful and appropriate to you.

In an NGL course, do you have to learn to stop worrying and love the knowledge you can't know everything?

And doing this is hard.

<h3>Uncertainty</h3>

The NGL course itself has been emerging fairly quickly. This has likely created an enhanced level of uncertainty amongst participants beyond the need to make the above transformation. Something that hasn't been helped perhaps by the lack of appropriate modeling of this practice from others.

<h3>Groups versus networks</h3>

I wonder if the distinction between network and group is also part of this. Many online courses take the group approach. People working toward common outcomes or projects. Which in turns requires a more synchronous approach to participation as others are directly depending on your contribution.

The NGL course is (in my head) trying to take a more network approach.  There isn't a common outcome or project.  Everyone is working on their own projects as student, learner and teacher. They are working on roughly the same schedule but it's intended to be a fairly flexible schedule. You do what you need, when you need it as much as possible.  With there really only being two fixed deadlines, and even they are fairly flexible.

If you need to drop out for a while and work on something, then you should be able to and then reconnect as needed when you return.  Perhaps not necessarily catch up on all the conversations.  Plus if ideas have moved on, that's a positive in terms of being able to learn from that.

Do others feel this about the course? Or is it just a group-based online course in a network course's clothing?</p>
