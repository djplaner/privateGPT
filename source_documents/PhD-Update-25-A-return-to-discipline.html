<p>Tags: phd, thesis, Uncategorized</p>

<p><p>The <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/09/11/phd-update-24-off-to-the-crocodile-form/">last PhD update</a> I posted here was in early November last year.  It's time to get back into the discipline of posting these updates, especially now I'm in the downhill stretch.</p>
<p>The rationale/excuse for not having posted in the last 3 or 4 months has been work and Christmas.  For most of November, I was traveling to or working on conference presentations. I also visited Canberra in that time to work a bit on the thesis and received feedback from my supervisor - reduce content!.  December was holidays and then, the great plan to spend January on holiday, working on the thesis went pear shape.  For various silly, contextual issues I spent most of January and February working on <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">BIM</a> so folk could use it starting around March.  This will hopefully bring some benefits, but it didn't help thesis completion.</p>

<h3>What I did last week</h3>

<p>Early last week I had completed rough first drafts of chapters 2 (lit review) and 3 (research method).  Since then, when time allows, I've been re-reading these drafts and making the slight modifications that are needed.  A bit of space - it's been almost 3 weeks since I finished the draft of chapter 2 - does wonders for perspective.</p>
<p>I've re-read all of chapter 2 and annotated it with suggested changes.  I'm almost half way through making those changes in the soft copy.</p>

<h3>What I'll do in the next week</h3>

<p>The aim for the next week is to have completed first drafts of chapters 2 and 3 sent off to my supervisor. </p>
<p>Time willing, the plan is then to get chapter 4 into the same state.  I have until April 6 to get chapters in this state and sent to my supervisor.</p></p>
