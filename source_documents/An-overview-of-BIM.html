<p><p>Just uploaded a screencast/presentation that is essentially a cut down version of the presentation I gave at Moodlemoot'AU 2010 last week. There's an embedded version below or you can find the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/13470794">original on vimeo</a>.  There's also <a href="https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/">more information about BIM elsewhere</a> and you can <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/moodle-mod_bim/">download BIM from here (for Moodle 1.9.x)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/djplaner/moodle-mod_bim/tree/bim2">BIM for Moodle 2.x here</a> (look for the "Zip" button).</p>
